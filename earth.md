First 100 days of the first Donald Trump presidency

For a chronological listing of events during this period, see [Timeline of the Donald Trump presidency (2017 Q1)](./Timeline_of_the_Donald_Trump_presidency_\(2017_Q1\) "Timeline of the Donald Trump presidency (2017 Q1)") and [Timeline of the Donald Trump presidency (2017 Q2)](./Timeline_of_the_Donald_Trump_presidency_\(2017_Q2\) "Timeline of the Donald Trump presidency (2017 Q2)").

Donald Trump outlines his plan for the first 100 days of his presidency on November 21, 2016.

The **[first 100 days](./First_hundred_days_\(United_States\) "First hundred days (United States)") of the first Donald Trump presidency** began on January 20, 2017, the day [Donald Trump](./Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") was [inaugurated](./First_inauguration_of_Donald_Trump "First inauguration of Donald Trump") as the 45th [president of the United States](./President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States"). The first 100 days of a presidential term took on symbolic significance during [Franklin D. Roosevelt](./Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt")'s first term in office, and the period is considered a benchmark to measure the early success of a president. The 100th day of his [presidency](./First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump "First presidency of Donald Trump") ended on April 30, 2017.

Institutionally, President Trump had the advantage of a [Republican Party](./Republican_Party_\(United_States\) "Republican Party (United States)") majority in the U.S. [House of Representatives](./United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives") and the [Senate](./United_States_Senate "United States Senate"), but was unable to fulfill his major pledges in his first 100 days, with some [approval rating](./United_States_presidential_approval_rating "United States presidential approval rating") polls reporting around 40%. He reversed his position on a number of issues including labeling China as a [currency manipulator](./Currency_intervention "Currency intervention"), NATO, launching the [2017 Shayrat missile strike](./2017_Shayrat_missile_strike "2017 Shayrat missile strike"), renomination of [Janet Yellen](./Janet_Yellen "Janet Yellen") as [Chair of the Federal Reserve](./Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve "Chair of the Federal Reserve"), and the nomination of [Export-Import Bank](./Export–Import_Bank_of_the_United_States "Export–Import Bank of the United States") directors. Trump's approval among his base was high, with 96% of those who voted for him saying in an April 2017 poll that they would vote for him again. Near the end of the 100 days, the Trump administration introduced a broad outline of a sweeping [tax reform](./Tax_reform "Tax reform") focusing on deep [tax cuts](./Tax_cut "Tax cut"). Although Trump had to concede to delay funding for [the U.S.–Mexico border wall](./Trump_wall "Trump wall") he had promised, narrowly avoiding a [government shutdown](./Government_shutdown_in_the_United_States "Government shutdown in the United States") a few days before the end of the first 100 days.

Trump signed 24 [executive orders](./Executive_order_\(United_States\) "Executive order (United States)") in his first 100 days. He signed 22 [presidential memoranda](./Presidential_memoranda "Presidential memoranda"), 20 [presidential proclamations](./Presidential_proclamation "Presidential proclamation"), and 28 [bills](./Bill_\(United_States_Congress\) "Bill (United States Congress)"). About a dozen of those bills roll-back regulations finalized during the last months of his immediate predecessor [Barack Obama](./Barack_Obama "Barack Obama")'s presidency using the [Congressional Review Act](./Congressional_Review_Act "Congressional Review Act"). Most of the other bills are "small-scale measures that appoint personnel, name federal facilities or modify existing programs." None of Trump's bills are considered to be "major bills"—based on a "longstanding political-science standard for 'major bills'". Presidential historian [Michael Beschloss](./Michael_Beschloss "Michael Beschloss") said that "based on a legislative standard"—which is what the first 100 days has been judged on since the tenure of President [Franklin D. Roosevelt](./Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt"), who enacted 76 laws in 100 days including nine that were "major".

## Pledges

Trump pledged to do the following in his first 100 days:

*   Appoint judges "who will uphold the Constitution" and "defend the [Second Amendment](./Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution")"
*   Construct a [wall](./Mexico–United_States_barrier#Trump_administration "Mexico–United States barrier") on the [southern U.S. border](./Mexico–United_States_border "Mexico–United States border") and limit illegal immigration "to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs"
*   Re-assess trade agreements with other nations and "crack down" on companies that send jobs overseas

*   Use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of 45% tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the [Trade Act of 1974](./Trade_Act_of_1974 "Trade Act of 1974"), and Section 232 of the [Trade Expansion Act](./Trade_Expansion_Act "Trade Expansion Act") of 1962 to stop China's illegal activities, including [its theft of American trade secrets](./Chinese_intelligence_operations_in_the_United_States "Chinese intelligence operations in the United States").

## Inauguration

Main article: [First inauguration of Donald Trump](./First_inauguration_of_Donald_Trump "First inauguration of Donald Trump")

The first 100 days of the Presidency of [Donald Trump](./Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") began during the [inauguration of Donald Trump](./First_inauguration_of_Donald_Trump "First inauguration of Donald Trump") with the conversion of [Whitehouse.gov](./Whitehouse.gov "Whitehouse.gov") from the [Obama Administration](./Presidency_of_Barack_Obama "Presidency of Barack Obama") version to the Trump Administration version at 12:00 pm on January 20, 2017. This was the third presidential online portal transition and the first to transition [social media](./Social_media "Social media") accounts such as [Twitter](./Twitter "Twitter"). As Trump took the [oath of office](./Oath_of_office_of_the_president_of_the_United_States "Oath of office of the president of the United States"), the official @POTUS Twitter account switched to President Trump with [Barack Obama](./Barack_Obama "Barack Obama")'s previous tweets archived under @POTUS44.

## Administration and Cabinet

Main article: [First cabinet of Donald Trump](./First_cabinet_of_Donald_Trump "First cabinet of Donald Trump")

On February 8, when Trump formally announced his 24-member-cabinet—the largest cabinet of any President so far—fewer cabinet nominees had been confirmed than any other president except [George Washington](./George_Washington "George Washington") by the same length of time into his presidency. Trump's reorganization of the cabinet removed the [Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers](./Council_of_Economic_Advisers#Chairmen_and_members "Council of Economic Advisers") that [President Obama](./Barack_Obama "Barack Obama") had added in 2009. The [Director of National Intelligence](./Director_of_National_Intelligence "Director of National Intelligence") and [Director of the CIA](./Director_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency "Director of the Central Intelligence Agency") were elevated to cabinet-level. During the transition period, Trump had named a full slate of Cabinet and Cabinet-level nominees, all of which require Senate confirmation except for White House Chief of Staff and the vice presidency.

By April 29, almost all of his nominated cabinet members had been confirmed, including Secretaries of [State](./United_States_Secretary_of_State "United States Secretary of State") [Rex Tillerson](./Rex_Tillerson "Rex Tillerson"), [Treasury](./United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury "United States Secretary of the Treasury") [Steven Mnuchin](./Steven_Mnuchin "Steven Mnuchin"), [Defense](./United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense") [James Mattis](./James_Mattis "James Mattis"), [Justice](./United_States_Department_of_Justice "United States Department of Justice") [Jeff Sessions](./Jeff_Sessions "Jeff Sessions"), [the Interior](./United_States_Secretary_of_the_Interior "United States Secretary of the Interior") [Ryan Zinke](./Ryan_Zinke "Ryan Zinke"), [Secretary of Agriculture](./United_States_Secretary_of_Agriculture "United States Secretary of Agriculture") [Sonny Perdue](./Sonny_Perdue "Sonny Perdue"), [Commerce](./United_States_Secretary_of_Commerce "United States Secretary of Commerce") [Wilbur Ross](./Wilbur_Ross "Wilbur Ross"), [Secretary of Labor](./United_States_Secretary_of_Labor "United States Secretary of Labor") [Alex Acosta](./Alexander_Acosta "Alexander Acosta"), [Health and Human Services](./United_States_Secretary_of_Health_and_Human_Services "United States Secretary of Health and Human Services") HHS [Tom Price](./Tom_Price_\(American_politician\) "Tom Price (American politician)"), [Housing and Urban Development](./United_States_Secretary_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development "United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development") HUD [Ben Carson](./Ben_Carson "Ben Carson"), [Transportation](./United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation "United States Secretary of Transportation") [Elaine Chao](./Elaine_Chao "Elaine Chao"), [Energy](./United_States_Secretary_of_Energy "United States Secretary of Energy") [Rick Perry](./Rick_Perry "Rick Perry"), [Education](./Department_of_Education "Department of Education") [Betsy DeVos](./Betsy_DeVos "Betsy DeVos"), [Veterans Affairs](./United_States_Secretary_of_Veterans_Affairs "United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs") [David Shulkin](./David_Shulkin "David Shulkin"), [Homeland Security](./United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security "United States Secretary of Homeland Security") [John Kelly](./John_F._Kelly "John F. Kelly"), [Director of the Central Intelligence Agency](./Director_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency "Director of the Central Intelligence Agency") (CIA) [Mike Pompeo](./Mike_Pompeo "Mike Pompeo"), [UN Ambassador](./United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations "United States Ambassador to the United Nations") [Nikki R. Haley](./Nikki_Haley "Nikki Haley"), [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](./United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency "United States Environmental Protection Agency") [Scott Pruitt](./Scott_Pruitt "Scott Pruitt"), [Small Business Administration](./Small_Business_Administration "Small Business Administration") [Linda McMahon](./Linda_McMahon "Linda McMahon"), [Management and Budget](./Office_of_Management_and_Budget "Office of Management and Budget") OMB [Mick Mulvaney](./Mick_Mulvaney "Mick Mulvaney"), and [Director of National Intelligence](./Director_of_National_Intelligence "Director of National Intelligence") [Dan Coats](./Dan_Coats "Dan Coats"). Only two were awaiting confirmation—[Trade Representative](./Office_of_the_United_States_Trade_Representative "Office of the United States Trade Representative") [Robert Lighthizer](./Robert_Lighthizer "Robert Lighthizer") and [Council of Economic Advisers](./Council_of_Economic_Advisers "Council of Economic Advisers") CEA [Kevin Hassett](./Kevin_Hassett "Kevin Hassett").

James Mattis was confirmed on January 20 as [Secretary of Defense](./United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense") by a vote of 98–1. Mattis had previously received a waiver of the [National Security Act of 1947](./National_Security_Act_of_1947 "National Security Act of 1947"), which requires a seven-year waiting period before retired military personnel can assume the role of [Secretary of Defense](./United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense"). [John Kelly](./John_F._Kelly "John F. Kelly") was confirmed as [United States Secretary of Homeland Security](./United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security "United States Secretary of Homeland Security") on the first day by a vote of 88–11. Former [ExxonMobil](./ExxonMobil "ExxonMobil") CEO [Rex Tillerson](./Rex_Tillerson "Rex Tillerson") was sworn in as [Secretary of State](./United_States_Secretary_of_State "United States Secretary of State") by [Vice-President](./Vice_President_of_the_United_States "Vice President of the United States") [Mike Pence](./Mike_Pence "Mike Pence") on February 1. Trump nominated Tillerson for the position as top U.S. diplomat (the equivalent of a [foreign minister](./Foreign_minister "Foreign minister")) on December 13, 2016. He was approved by the [Senate Foreign Relations Committee](./Senate_Foreign_Relations_Committee "Senate Foreign Relations Committee") on January 23, 2017, and by the full Senate in a 56–43 vote. Nikki Haley was confirmed as UN Ambassador with a Senate vote of 96 to 4.

On January 26, 2017, when Tillerson visited the [United States State Department](./United_States_State_Department "United States State Department"), Undersecretaries [Joyce Anne Barr](./Joyce_Anne_Barr "Joyce Anne Barr"), [Patrick F. Kennedy](./Patrick_F._Kennedy "Patrick F. Kennedy"), [Michele Bond](./Michele_Bond "Michele Bond"), and [Gentry O. Smith](./Gentry_O._Smith "Gentry O. Smith") all simultaneously resigned from the department. Former State Department chief of staff David Wade called the resignations "the single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember." The Trump administration told CNN the officials had been fired and the _Chicago Tribune_ reported that several senior state department career diplomats left the State Department, claiming they "had been willing to remain at their posts but had no expectation of staying."

On February 10, [Tom Price](./Tom_Price_\(American_politician\) "Tom Price (American politician)") was confirmed as [Secretary](./United_States_Secretary_of_Health_and_Human_Services "United States Secretary of Health and Human Services") of [Health and Human Services](./United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services "United States Department of Health and Human Services") (HHS), a "$1 trillion government department". HHS includes [National Institutes of Health](./National_Institutes_of_Health "National Institutes of Health") (NIH), the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](./Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"), and the [Food and Drug Administration](./Food_and_Drug_Administration "Food and Drug Administration") (FDA). Price, who is a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act, will oversee its repeal and replacement. He has published articles in the "small, conservative medical association", the [Association of American Physicians and Surgeons](./Association_of_American_Physicians_and_Surgeons "Association of American Physicians and Surgeons"), to which he belongs, that opposes mandatory vaccination and continue to argue that the [vaccines](./Vaccines "Vaccines") causes [autism](./Autism "Autism"), a "discredited conspiracy theory that Trump has long espoused". In response to questions from Senators at the hearing as to whether he believes autism is caused by vaccines, he responded, "I think the science in that instance is that it does not".

[Steve Mnuchin](./Steve_Mnuchin "Steve Mnuchin"), who was nominated by Trump in November 2016, was finally confirmed on February 13, 2017, as [Secretary](./United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury "United States Secretary of the Treasury") of the [Treasury department](./United_States_Department_of_Treasury "United States Department of Treasury") after lengthy confirmation hearings.

On February 16, the Senate voted 54 to 46 to advance [Scott Pruitt](./Scott_Pruitt "Scott Pruitt")'s nomination as [Administrator](./Administrator_of_the_Environmental_Protection_Agency "Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency") of the [Environmental Protection Agency](./United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency "United States Environmental Protection Agency"). On February 16, a District Court Judge in Oklahoma, Aletia Timmons, ordered Pruitt to "turn over thousands of emails related to his communication with the oil, gas and coal industry" in a case brought to court by the [Center for Media and Democracy](./Center_for_Media_and_Democracy "Center for Media and Democracy"). Lawmakers had criticized Pruitt who sued the EPA 14 times on behalf of the State of Oklahoma.

Trump nominated [Alexander Acosta](./Alexander_Acosta "Alexander Acosta") as [Secretary of Labor](./United_States_Secretary_of_Labor "United States Secretary of Labor") on February 16, when his first nominee [Andrew Puzder](./Andrew_Puzder "Andrew Puzder") [stepped down](./Unsuccessful_nominations_to_the_Cabinet_of_the_United_States "Unsuccessful nominations to the Cabinet of the United States") under a wave of criticism for having employed an illegal immigrant as a former housekeeper, for his "remarks on women and employees at his restaurants" and for his "rancorous 1980s divorce".

## Notable non-Cabinet positions

See also: [Political appointments of Donald Trump](./Political_appointments_of_Donald_Trump "Political appointments of Donald Trump")

According to a database compiled by _The Washington Post_ in collaboration with the [Partnership for Public Service](./Partnership_for_Public_Service "Partnership for Public Service"), as of April 27, 473 of the 554 key executive branch nominations that require Presidential nomination and Senate confirmation, had not yet been appointed, including "Cabinet secretaries, deputy and assistant secretaries, chief financial officers, general counsel, heads of agencies, ambassadors and other critical leadership positions." Only three of the 119 Department of State executive branch positions have been filled and only one position in the Department of Defense—the Secretary of Defense, James Mattis—has been filled out of 53 key positions. Trump has not yet nominated anyone for 49 of these positions. On February 28, in an exclusive interview Tuesday with Fox & Friends, said, "a lot of those jobs, I don't want to appoint, because they're unnecessary to have. ... You know, we have so many people in government, even me. I look at some of the jobs and it's people over people over people. I say, 'What do all these people do?' You don't need all those jobs ... Many of those jobs I don't want to fill. I say, isn't that a good thing? That's not a bad thing. That's a good thing. We're running a very good, efficient government."

Prior to taking office, Trump named several important White House advisers to positions that do not require Senate confirmation, including [Stephen K. Bannon](./Steve_Bannon "Steve Bannon") as his "senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist" and [Reince Priebus](./Reince_Priebus "Reince Priebus") as [Chief of Staff](./Chief_of_Staff "Chief of Staff"), with a mission "as equal partners to transform the federal government." Other important advisers outside of the Cabinet include ([Counselor to the President](./Counselor_to_the_President "Counselor to the President")) [Kellyanne Conway](./Kellyanne_Conway "Kellyanne Conway"), [Senior Advisor](./Senior_Advisor_to_the_President_of_the_United_States "Senior Advisor to the President of the United States") ([National Security Advisor](./National_Security_Advisor_\(United_States\) "National Security Advisor (United States)")) [Michael Flynn](./Michael_T._Flynn "Michael T. Flynn") (replaced by [H. R. McMaster](./H._R._McMaster "H. R. McMaster")) and ([National Trade Council](./White_House_National_Trade_Council "White House National Trade Council")) Director [Peter Navarro](./Peter_Navarro "Peter Navarro"). (Homeland Security Adviser) [Thomas P. Bossert](./Tom_Bossert "Tom Bossert"), (Regulatory Czar) [Carl Icahn](./Carl_Icahn "Carl Icahn"), (White House Counsel) [Donald F. "Don" McGahn II](./Don_McGahn "Don McGahn"), and (Press Secretary) [Sean Spicer](./Sean_Spicer "Sean Spicer").

[Michael T. Flynn](./Michael_T._Flynn "Michael T. Flynn") served as Trump's [National Security Advisor](./National_Security_Advisor_\(United_States\) "National Security Advisor (United States)") from January 20 until his resignation on February 13, 2017. He set a record for the shortest tenure as National Security Advisor in American history. The Justice Department warned the Trump administration that Flynn, who had a "well-established history with Russia", may have been "vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow". Flynn had "mischaracterized his communications" with Russian Ambassador [Sergey Kislyak](./Sergey_Kislyak "Sergey Kislyak") to Vice President [Mike Pence](./Mike_Pence "Mike Pence") regarding [U.S. sanctions on Russia](./International_sanctions_during_the_Ukrainian_crisis "International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis"). Flynn's phone calls had been "recorded by a government wiretap" and several days after Flynn was named as Trump's Advisor, [Sally Yates](./Sally_Yates "Sally Yates"), who was then acting attorney general, warned the White House that "Flynn was susceptible to blackmail by the Russians because he had misled Mr. Pence and other officials". According to a February 14 article by _The New York Times_, it was unclear why the White House did not react to Yates' warning in early January. There were also questions about how much was known in early January by Bannon, Pence, Spicer, and Trump. Yates was fired on January 30, in an unrelated incident.

On February 20, 2017, Trump named "warrior-scholar deemed an expert in counter insurgency", Lieutenant General [H. R. McMaster](./H._R._McMaster "H. R. McMaster"), to replace Flynn as National Security Advisor. Trump overruled McMaster's attempt to replace 30-year-old NSC aide [Ezra Cohen-Watnick](./Ezra_Cohen-Watnick "Ezra Cohen-Watnick"), a Mike Flynn appointee, with Linda Weissgold, when Bannon and Kushner intervened on Cohen-Watnick's behalf on March 11–12. Cohen-Watnick gathered classified files on intelligence information on U.S. persons.

On January 28, 2017, Trump signed a Memorandum, the Organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council which restructured the Principals Committee—the senior policy committee—of the National Security Council, assigning a permanent invitation to Steve Bannon, [White House Chief Strategist](./White_House_Chief_Strategist "White House Chief Strategist"), while at the same time withdrawing the permanent invitations of the [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff](./Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff") and [Director of National Intelligence](./Director_of_National_Intelligence "Director of National Intelligence"). On April 5, the 75th day of Trump's presidency, under guidance from Army Lieutenant General [H. R. McMaster](./H._R._McMaster "H. R. McMaster"), the [National Security Advisor](./National_Security_Advisor_\(United_States\) "National Security Advisor (United States)") (NSC advisor) who replaced Mike Flynn, Trump removed Bannon, who has no security experience, from the National Security Council's principals committee.

Trump's 36-year-old son-in-law, Jared Kushner is Trump's [Senior Advisor](./Senior_Advisor_to_the_President_of_the_United_States "Senior Advisor to the President of the United States") alongside [Stephen Miller](./Stephen_Miller_\(political_operative\) "Stephen Miller (political operative)"). "In his January interview with the _Times of London_, Trump said that Kushner would be in charge of brokering peace in the [Israeli–Palestinian conflict](./Israeli–Palestinian_conflict "Israeli–Palestinian conflict"). He is also a "top adviser on relations with Canada, China and Mexico". On April 3, Kushner accompanied the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General [Joseph F. Dunford Jr.](./Joseph_Dunford "Joseph Dunford") and [Homeland Security Advisor](./Homeland_Security_Advisor "Homeland Security Advisor") [Thomas P. Bossert](./Tom_Bossert "Tom Bossert") to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister [Haider al-Abadi](./Haider_al-Abadi "Haider al-Abadi") "to discuss the fight against the Islamic State and whether the United States would leave troops in Iraq afterward." Trump named Kushner as head of the White House [Office of American Innovation](./Office_of_American_Innovation "Office of American Innovation"), (OAI), established on March 29 and mandated to use ideas from the private-sector to overhaul all federal agencies and departments in order to "spur job creation". One of the OAI's first priorities is to modernize the technology of departments such as Veterans Affairs. In his new position, Kushner will work with [Chris Christie](./Chris_Christie "Chris Christie"), who will chair the newly established "President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis" in response to Trump's pledge to combat [opioid abuse](./Opioid_abuse "Opioid abuse").

On January 28, in his [eleventh Presidential Memoranda](./List_of_executive_actions_by_Donald_Trump "List of executive actions by Donald Trump"), "Organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council", [White House Chief Strategist](./White_House_Chief_Strategist "White House Chief Strategist"), Steve Bannon, was designated as a regular attendee to the [National Security Council](./United_States_National_Security_Council "United States National Security Council") (NSC)′s Principals Committee, a Cabinet-level senior interagency forum for considering national security issues, in a departure from the previous format in which this role is usually held for generals. While at first there was some confusion over meeting attendees, Priebus clarified on January 30, that defense officials could attend the meetings. On April 5, the 75th day of Trump's presidency, under guidance from Army Lieutenant General [H. R. McMaster](./H._R._McMaster "H. R. McMaster"), the [National Security Advisor](./National_Security_Advisor_\(United_States\) "National Security Advisor (United States)") (NSC advisor) who replaced Mike Flynn, Trump removed Bannon, who has no security experience, from the National Security Council's principals committee.

On February 2, _[Time](./Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")_ published an article about Bannon as potentially, the second most powerful man in the world, illustrated with a cover labeling him as the "Great Manipulator". After only a fortnight into Trump's presidency, _NPR_ described Bannon as "the power behind the throne" and the "[gray eminence](./Éminence_grise "Éminence grise") behind much of what Trump was prioritizing", rivalling Kushner's and Priebus' roles. Mike Pence affirmed in a _PBS NewsHour_ report that only Trump was "in charge".

Bannon and Steve Miller have been called the "architects" of the inaugural address, executive orders, including the controversial travel and refugees EO, and presidential memoranda.

In an often-cited October 8, 2015, lengthy profile entitled "This Man Is the Most Dangerous Political Operative in America" by [Joshua Green](./Joshua_Green_\(journalist\) "Joshua Green (journalist)"), a senior national correspondent for _Bloomberg News_, Green described how _[Breitbart News](./Breitbart_News "Breitbart News")_ with Bannon at its helm, had "championed Trump's presidential candidacy" and helped "coalesce a splinter faction of conservatives" who were irate over the way in which _Fox News_ had treated Trump. Green quoted then-Senator Jeff Sessions as an admirer of Breitbart, which was "extraordinarily influential", with many radio hosts "reading Breitbart every day". Trump cited _Breitbart News_ to vindicate his claims.

[Stephen Miller](./Stephen_Miller_\(political_operative\) "Stephen Miller (political operative)"), Trump's [Senior Advisor](./Senior_Advisor_to_the_President_of_the_United_States "Senior Advisor to the President of the United States"), was Jeff Sessions' communications director when he served as Senator for [Alabama](./Alabama "Alabama"). Thirty-one-year old Miller, Bannon, and [Andrew Bremberg](./Andrew_Bremberg "Andrew Bremberg") sent over 200 executive orders to federal agencies for review before January 20. Miller has been an architect behind the inaugural address and the most "contentious executive orders" including [Executive Order 13769](./Executive_Order_13769 "Executive Order 13769").

In a February 12 interview with [ABC News](./ABC_News_\(United_States\) "ABC News (United States)") anchor [George Stephanopoulos](./George_Stephanopoulos "George Stephanopoulos"), when asked to provide evidence "for Trump's "unfounded allegations" where former Senator [Kelly Ayotte](./Kelly_Ayotte "Kelly Ayotte") lost her bid for election, and Trump narrowly lost to Clinton in 2016, Miller suggested Stephanopoulos interview Kansas Senator, [Kris Kobach](./Kris_Kobach "Kris Kobach"), who relied upon a 2012 [Pew Research Center](./Pew_Research_Center "Pew Research Center") study in his voter fraud claims. The day before the interview a Federal Election Commission Commissioner called on Trump to provide evidence of what would "constitute thousands of felony criminal offenses under New Hampshire law."

[Gary Cohn](./Gary_Cohn_\(investment_banker\) "Gary Cohn (investment banker)"), the former [Goldman Sachs](./Goldman_Sachs "Goldman Sachs") investment banker and executive, took office on January 20, as Trump's Director of the [National Economic Council](./National_Economic_Council_\(United_States\) "National Economic Council (United States)"), (NEC), a position which did not require Congressional confirmation, By February 11, 2017, _The Wall Street Journal_ described Cohn as an "economic-policy powerhouse" in Trump's administration and _The New York Times_ called him Trump's "go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business and growth." While the confirmation of Trump's December 12, 2016, nominee for [Secretary of Treasury](./Secretary_of_Treasury "Secretary of Treasury"), [Steven Mnuchin](./Steven_Mnuchin "Steven Mnuchin"), was delayed until February 13 by Congressional hearings, Cohn filled in the "personnel vacuum" and pushed "ahead on taxes, infrastructure, financial regulation and replacing health-care law." In November, Trump considered offering Cohn the position as Secretary of Treasury. If Cohn had stayed at Goldman Sachs, some believed he would have become CEO when [Lloyd Blankfein](./Lloyd_Blankfein "Lloyd Blankfein") vacated that office and his $285 million severance package "raised eyebrows" according to CNN. Bannon and Cohn disagree on the [border-adjustment tax](./Border-adjustment_tax_\(United_States\) "Border-adjustment tax (United States)"), the centerpiece of [Paul Ryan](./Paul_Ryan "Paul Ryan")'s controversial tax reforms presented on February 17, which includes a 20% import tax, export subsidies and a 15% reduction in corporate tax rates that would, among other things, pay for the Mexican wall, which according to a _[The Washington Post](./The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")_ study, would cost $25 billion and which Trump stated would cost $12 billion.

### United States Domestic Policy Council

Main article: [United States Domestic Policy Council](./United_States_Domestic_Policy_Council "United States Domestic Policy Council")

The Domestic Policy Council (DPC) consists of Trump and [Andrew Bremberg](./Andrew_Bremberg "Andrew Bremberg") as Directors with Paul Winfree as Deputy Assistant. Council attendees include Mike Pence, Jeff Sessions, Tom Price, John F. Kelly, David Shulkin, Ryan Zinke, Betsy DeVos, Ben Carson, Elaine Chao, Wilbur Ross, Rick Perry, Steven Mnuchin, and—when appointed—the [Secretary of Labor](./United_States_Secretary_of_Labor "United States Secretary of Labor") and the [Secretary of Agriculture](./Secretary_of_Agriculture "Secretary of Agriculture"). Additional attendees include Scott Pruitt, [Mick Mulvaney](./Mick_Mulvaney "Mick Mulvaney") (Director of the [Office of Management and Budget](./Office_of_Management_and_Budget "Office of Management and Budget")), Gary Cohn, and—when appointed—the Chair of the [Council of Economic Advisers](./Council_of_Economic_Advisers "Council of Economic Advisers") and the Director of the [Office of National Drug Control Policy](./Office_of_National_Drug_Control_Policy "Office of National Drug Control Policy"). The Congressional Research Service describes DPC's role as analyses of domestic policies and social programs including "education, labor and worker safety; health-care insurance and financing; health services and research; aging policy studies; Social Security, pensions and disability insurance; immigration, homeland security, domestic intelligence and criminal justice; and welfare, nutrition and housing programs."

### Withdrawal of the Affordable Care Act

Within the first hours of Trump's presidency, he signed his [first](./List_of_executive_actions_by_Donald_Trump "List of executive actions by Donald Trump") [executive order](./Executive_order_\(United_States\) "Executive order (United States)"), [Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal](./Executive_Order_13765 "Executive Order 13765") (EO 13765) to fulfill part of his pledge to repeal the [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act](./Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act") (ACA), which was part of a [series of steps](./Timeline_of_efforts_to_repeal_the_Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act "Timeline of efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act") taken prior to 2017 to repeal and defund the ACA, including most recently, the [FY2017](./2017_United_States_federal_budget "2017 United States federal budget") [budget resolution](./Budget_resolution "Budget resolution"), [S.Con.Res.](./Concurrent_resolution "Concurrent resolution") 3, that contained language allowing the repeal of ACA through the [budget reconciliation](./Reconciliation_\(United_States_Congress\) "Reconciliation (United States Congress)") process. A CBO report estimated 18 million people would lose their insurance and premiums would rise by 20% to 25% in the first year after repealing Obamacare. Uninsured could reach 32 million by 2026, while premiums could double. The order states what Trump made clear during his campaign: that it is his administration's policy to seek the "prompt repeal" of Obamacare. During his [Fox News](./Fox_News "Fox News") interview with [Bill O'Reilly](./Bill_O'Reilly_\(political_commentator\) "Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)") airing before the [Super Bowl](./Super_Bowl "Super Bowl"), Trump announced that the timeline for replacing Obamacare had to be extended and that a replacement would probably not be ready until 2018. Republicans are limited as to how much of ACA they can undo as they do not have a 60-vote majority in the Senate. They also "must balance the interests of insurers and medical providers". According to the March 13, 2017, report by the nonpartisan [Congressional Budget Office](./Congressional_Budget_Office "Congressional Budget Office") and staff of the [Joint Committee on Taxation](./Joint_Committee_on_Taxation "Joint Committee on Taxation") (JCT) on the budgetary impact of the Republican bill to repeal and replace ACA over the coming decade, there would be a $337 billion reduction in the federal deficit and an estimated loss of coverage to 24 million more Americans. The Republican health-care plan was unveiled on March 6 and faced opposition from both moderate and conservative Republicans, such as the [House Freedom Caucus](./House_Freedom_Caucus "House Freedom Caucus"). The [American Health Care Act of 2017](./American_Health_Care_Act_of_2017 "American Health Care Act of 2017") (AHCA), a bill to repeal and replace the ACA, was withdrawn in Congress on March 24, 2017, due to lack of support from within the Republican caucus.

### Immigration policy

Main article: [Immigration policy of Donald Trump](./Immigration_policy_of_Donald_Trump "Immigration policy of Donald Trump")

In his first 100 days, President Trump signed executive orders to set in motion travel bans and restrictions on refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, increased immigration enforcement including deportations, and expanded efforts to prevent illegal entry into the United States by building a wall along the [Mexico–United States border](./Mexico–United_States_border "Mexico–United States border"). While the numbers of people deported were very similar to those in 2016, the categories of people targeted for deportations was broadened during this period, which meant that many more people are at a heightened risk of deportation. Secretary Kelly clarified that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) "will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement." By April 3, according to ICE, there had been 35,604 removals in January and February 2017 compared to 35,255 in the same period in 2016. But the "tough rhetoric" and some "high-profile Ice operations" widely cited in the media resulted in widespread fear and panic within immigrant communities.

In an AP April 20 interview, Trump said that, "The dreamers should rest easy". There are 800,000 young people protected by Obama's "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals" (DREAMERS) who came to the U.S. as children and are living there illegally. Some of these "dreamers" in interviews with The Associated Press on April 21, said they "were not comforted by Trump's pledge" particularly since the April 18 deportation of 23-year-old "dreamer", Juan Manuel Montes. Trump supporters who are "immigration hard-liners", such as [NumbersUSA](./NumbersUSA "NumbersUSA") and [Mark Krikorian](./Mark_Krikorian_\(activist\) "Mark Krikorian (activist)") of the [Center for Immigration Studies](./Center_for_Immigration_Studies "Center for Immigration Studies"), feel deceived by Trump's softening stance on DREAMERs arguing that "\[h\]is promise on DACA was pretty clear and unequivocal".

#### Travel ban and refugee suspension

Main articles: [Executive Order 13769](./Executive_Order_13769 "Executive Order 13769"), [Reactions to Executive Order 13769](./Reactions_to_Executive_Order_13769 "Reactions to Executive Order 13769"), and [Legal challenges to Executive Order 13769](./Legal_challenges_to_Executive_Order_13769 "Legal challenges to Executive Order 13769")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Executive_Order_no._13769_ban_map.svg/270px-Executive_Order_no._13769_ban_map.svg.png)](./File:Executive_Order_no._13769_ban_map.svg)Map of countries affected by [Executive Order 13769](./Executive_Order_13769 "Executive Order 13769"). Collectively, the order applies to over 200 million people (approximate population of the seven countries) while about 90,000 people from these countries currently hold a US immigrant or non-immigrant visa.

On January 27, at 4:42 p.m EST, Trump signed [Executive Order 13769](./Executive_Order_13769 "Executive Order 13769"), entitled "[Protecting the Nation From Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals](./Executive_Order_13769 "Executive Order 13769")" which temporarily suspends the [U. S. Refugee Admissions Program](./United_States_Refugee_Admissions_Program "United States Refugee Admissions Program") (USRAP) for 120 days and denies entry to citizens of [Iraq](./Iraq "Iraq"), [Iran](./Iran "Iran"), [Libya](./Libya "Libya"), [Somalia](./Somalia "Somalia"), [Sudan](./Sudan "Sudan"), [Syria](./Syria "Syria") and [Yemen](./Yemen "Yemen") for 90 days. The suspension for Syrian refugees is for an indefinite period of time. _[The Economist](./The_Economist "The Economist")_ described the order as "drafted in secret, enacted in haste and unlikely to fulfill its declared aim of sparing America from terrorism" with "Republican allies" lamenting that a "fine, popular policy was marred by its execution." Notably [Saudi Arabia](./Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia") was not on the list though most of the 9/11 hijackers were from there. See [Provisions of Order 13769](./Executive_Order_13769#Provisions "Executive Order 13769").

On February 4, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the State Department suspended all actions to implement the week-old EO in response to the February 3 ruling by federal judge [James Robart](./James_Louis_Robart "James Louis Robart") which blocked the EO. According to [CNN](./CNN "CNN") and the _[Los Angeles Times](./Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times")_, the architects behind the order, were [Stephen Miller](./Stephen_Miller_\(political_operative\) "Stephen Miller (political operative)") and [Steve Bannon](./Steve_Bannon "Steve Bannon"). White House officials deny that it was written without input from the U.S. Department of Justice's [Office of Legal Counsel](./Office_of_Legal_Counsel "Office of Legal Counsel") (OLC). It was argued that these seven countries ranked among the lowest 15 of the 104 countries evaluated by the [Henley & Partners Visa Restrictions Index](./Henley_&_Partners_Visa_Restrictions_Index "Henley & Partners Visa Restrictions Index") in 2016 based on the "number of countries that their citizens can travel to visa-free". For example, Germany ranks the highest at 177 points, Afghanistan the lowest of all 104 at 25. The order also calls for an expedited completion and implementation of the [Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System](./Office_of_Biometric_Identity_Management "Office of Biometric Identity Management") for all travelers coming into the United States. The first legal challenge against the EO was filed on January 28, and within two days there were dozens of [ongoing lawsuits](./Legal_challenges_to_Executive_Order_13769 "Legal challenges to Executive Order 13769") in the [United States federal courts](./United_States_federal_courts "United States federal courts"). By February 3, [federal judge](./United_States_federal_judge "United States federal judge"), James Robart temporarily blocked the week-old EO which opened American airports to visa holders from the seven targeted countries. At the international level legal concerns have been raised by the [UN](./United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Human_Rights "United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights"), [Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein](./Zeid_Ra'ad_al_Hussein "Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein"), who claimed that "discrimination on nationality alone is forbidden under human rights law." On January 30, in a telephone call to Trump, [German Chancellor](./German_Chancellor "German Chancellor") [Angela Merkel](./Angela_Merkel "Angela Merkel") explained that his EO "ran counter to the duties of all signatory states" to the [Geneva Refugee Convention](./1951_Convention_relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees "1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees") "to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds".

Thousands [protested](./2017_United_States_Donald_Trump_airport_protests "2017 United States Donald Trump airport protests") at [airports](./List_of_protests_against_Executive_Order_13769 "List of protests against Executive Order 13769") and other locations throughout the United States. Critics of the ban include most [Democrats](./Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)") and several top Republican Congressmen, former President Obama, the [Council on American–Islamic Relations](./Council_on_American–Islamic_Relations "Council on American–Islamic Relations"), over a dozen [state attorneys general](./State_attorneys_general "State attorneys general"), thousands of academics, Nobel laureates, [technology companies](./Technology_industry "Technology industry"), Iran, France, Germany, and 800,000 petitioners in Britain. Supporters of the ban include 82% of GOP voters, Paul Ryan, [Bob Goodlatte](./Bob_Goodlatte "Bob Goodlatte"), [Czech President](./President_of_the_Czech_Republic "President of the Czech Republic") [Miloš Zeman](./Miloš_Zeman "Miloš Zeman"), and members of the European [far right](./Far_right "Far right"). According to an IPSOS online poll conducted on January 31, in response to the question, "Do you agree or disagree with the Executive Order that President Trump signed blocking refugees and banning people from seven Muslim majority countries from entering the U.S.?", 48% of the 1,201 Americans polled agreed with the statement (23% of the 453 Democrats, 82% of the 478 Republicans, and 44% of the Independents polled).

On the evening of January 30, Trump replaced acting Attorney General [Sally Yates](./Sally_Yates "Sally Yates") with [Dana Boente](./Dana_Boente "Dana Boente"). Spicer's statement described Yates as an "Obama administration appointee" who had "betrayed the Department of Justice" by "refusing to enforce a legal order". In the Senate, [Chuck Schumer](./Chuck_Schumer "Chuck Schumer"), called her firing a Monday Night Massacre in reference to [Nixon](./Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon")'s firing of his attorney general, referred to as the [Saturday Night Massacre](./Saturday_Night_Massacre "Saturday Night Massacre") during [Watergate](./Watergate "Watergate"). Trump also replaced [DHS](./United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security "United States Department of Homeland Security")'s [ICE](./U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement") Chief [Daniel Ragsdale](./Daniel_Ragsdale "Daniel Ragsdale") with [Thomas Homan](./Thomas_Homan "Thomas Homan") as Acting Director in the evening of January 30.

In a live interview with [Chris Wallace](./Chris_Wallace "Chris Wallace") on January 29, _[Fox News Sunday](./Fox_News_Sunday "Fox News Sunday")_, [Kellyanne Conway](./Kellyanne_Conway "Kellyanne Conway"), justified the list of seven countries by claiming that the countries were originally identified as a threat in the Terrorist Prevention Act passed by Congress in 2015. HUD's Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015, was extended amid some controversy in February 2016, when it revoked the privilege of traveling to the States without a visa to people who "had recently traveled to Iraq, Syria, Iran or Sudan", as they were considered high-risk. A spokesman for former president Obama issued a statement stating, "The president \[Obama\] fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion." In his final press statement as president, Obama said, "There's a difference between \[the\] normal functioning of politics and certain issues or certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake," and stated his intention to speak out if a situation is serious enough. Obama encouraged Americans to protest the issue.

In response to a [temporary restraining order](./Temporary_restraining_order "Temporary restraining order") (TRO) issued in the case of _[State of Washington v. Trump](./State_of_Washington_v._Trump "State of Washington v. Trump")_, the [Department of Homeland Security](./Department_of_Homeland_Security "Department of Homeland Security") said on February 4 that it had stopped enforcing the portions of the executive order affected by the judgment, while the [State Department](./State_Department "State Department") activated visas that had been previously suspended. The restraining order was upheld by the [United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit](./United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit") on February 9, 2017.

On March 15, a [United States Federal Judge](./United_States_federal_judge "United States federal judge"), [Derrick Watson](./Derrick_Watson "Derrick Watson") of the [District Court of Hawaii](./United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Hawaii "United States District Court for the District of Hawaii"), issued a 43-page ruling which blocked Trump's revised March 6 [executive order 13780](./Executive_Order_13780 "Executive Order 13780") on the grounds that it violated the [First Amendment](./First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "First Amendment to the United States Constitution")'s [Establishment Clause](./Establishment_Clause "Establishment Clause") by disfavoring a particular religion. The temporary restraining order was converted to a preliminary injunction by Judge Watson on March 29. On an April 18 airing of the [Mark Levin Show](./Mark_Levin_Show "Mark Levin Show") Jeff Sessions commented, "We are confident that the President will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power."

#### High-profile ICE operations

On February 8, 2017, [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](./U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement") (ICE) agents arrested 35-year-old Guadalupe García de Rayos, when she attended her required annual review at the ICE office in Phoenix, and deported her to Mexico on the next day based on a removal order issued in 2013 by the Executive Office for Immigration Review. Immigrant advocates believe that she is the first to be deported after the EO was signed and that her deportation "reflects the severity" of the "crackdown" on illegal immigration. ICE officials said that her case went through multiple reviews in the immigration court system and that the "judges held she did not have a legal basis to remain in the US". In 2008, she was working at an amusement park in Mesa, Arizona when then-Sheriff [Joe Arpaio](./Joe_Arpaio "Joe Arpaio") ordered a raid that resulted in her arrest and felony identity theft conviction for possessing a false Social Security number. Arpaio was a subject of several [controversies](./Maricopa_County_Sheriff's_Office_controversies#Joe_Arpaio "Maricopa County Sheriff's Office controversies") during his tenure as sheriff. In 2015, the [U.S. Department of Justice](./United_States_Department_of_Justice "United States Department of Justice") partially settled a lawsuit filed against Arpaio for unlawful discriminatory police conduct, alleging that Arpaio had overseen the worst pattern of racial profiling in U.S. history. ICE officials in Los Angeles released a report on February 10, 2017, that about 160 foreign nationals were arrested in a five-day operation. Of those, 150 had criminal histories, and of the remaining arrests, five had final orders of removal or were previously deported. Ninety-five percent were male. Under Trump's EO, the definition of criminal is much more "sweeping" than Obama's, which "prioritized expulsion of undocumented immigrants who threatened public safety or national security, had ties to criminal gang activity, committed serious felony offenses or were habitual misdemeanor criminal offenders" and a single immigration officer decides. On the morning of February 14, ICE officials entered the [Des Moines](./Des_Moines,_Washington "Des Moines, Washington"), Washington family home of 23-year-old Daniel Ramirez Medina on an arrest warrant for Ramirez' father, who was taken into custody. Ramirez, who has no criminal record, entered the United States illegally as a child, and was later able to get a legal work permit through the 2012 [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals](./Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals") (DACA) policy, was placed in detention in the [Northwest Detention Center](./Northwest_Detention_Center "Northwest Detention Center"), [Tacoma, Washington](./Tacoma,_Washington "Tacoma, Washington"). According to ICE, Ramirez was detained based on "his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety". According to Ramirez's lawyer, Ramirez "unequivocally denies" these allegations and claimed ICE agents "repeatedly pressured" Ramirez to "falsely admit" gang affiliation. "The case raises questions about what it could mean for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children."

#### U.S.–Mexico border wall proposal

Main articles: [Mexico–United States relations § Trump administration](./Mexico–United_States_relations#Trump_administration "Mexico–United States relations"), [Mexico–United States barrier § Trump administration](./Mexico–United_States_barrier#Trump_administration "Mexico–United States barrier"), and [Executive Order 13767](./Executive_Order_13767 "Executive Order 13767")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/POTUS_visits_DHS_%2832174751680%29.jpg/220px-POTUS_visits_DHS_%2832174751680%29.jpg)](./File:POTUS_visits_DHS_\(32174751680\).jpg)President Trump signs an executive order at a ceremony at DHS headquarters.

While visiting the [Department of Homeland Security](./Department_of_Homeland_Security "Department of Homeland Security") (DHS) on January 25, President Trump signed his [third](./List_of_executive_actions_by_Donald_Trump "List of executive actions by Donald Trump") executive order [Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements](./Executive_Order_13767 "Executive Order 13767") (EO 13767) under the [(INA)](./Immigration_and_Nationality_Act "Immigration and Nationality Act"), the [Secure Fence Act](./Secure_Fence_Act_of_2006 "Secure Fence Act of 2006"), and the [(IIRIRA)](./Illegal_Immigration_Reform_and_Immigrant_Responsibility_Act_of_1996 "Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996") for the construction of a [Mexican border wall](./Mexico–United_States_barrier "Mexico–United States barrier") to deter illegal migration and smuggling of illegal products. The existing Mexico–United States barrier is not one continuous structure, but a series of physical walls and physical and "virtual" fences monitored by the [United States Border Patrol](./United_States_Border_Patrol "United States Border Patrol"). The proposed wall which would be "a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier" along the entire length of the border, which Trump estimated in 2016 would cost $10 billion to $12 billion, and by January 27 was estimated to be $20 billion, to be initially paid by Congress. Trump plans on eventually negotiating a reimbursement from the Mexican government. While the Executive Order entitled "[Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements](./Border_Security_and_Immigration_Enforcement_Improvements "Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements")", contains no information of payment, it requests federal agency reports by late March 2017 which "identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid."

On January 27, [Forbes](./Forbes "Forbes") cautioned that the 20% Mexican Import Tariff on all imported goods announced by Spicer to pay for the 1,933-mile (3,111 km) frontier wall would be "paid by Americans". GOP donors, Brothers [Charles](./Charles_Koch "Charles Koch") and [David Koch](./David_Koch "David Koch"), and their advocacy group, [Americans For Prosperity](./Americans_For_Prosperity "Americans For Prosperity"), oppose Paul Ryan's 'Buy American' Tax Plan, which they claim would add a "whopping tax hike of more than $1 trillion on American families and small businesses over 10 years." The import tariff would raise prices at Wal-Mart, for example, directly impacting lower income families.

_The Washington Post_ reported on April 25, that Trump had agreed to delaying funding for the construction of the wall until September to avoid a government shutdown.

#### Sanctuary cities

Main article: [Executive Order 13768](./Executive_Order_13768 "Executive Order 13768")

On January 25, Trump signed an executive order, "Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States", to the [Secretary of Homeland Security](./Secretary_of_Homeland_Security "Secretary of Homeland Security") and the [Attorney General](./Attorney_General_of_the_United_States "Attorney General of the United States") and their departments and agencies to increase the enforcement of immigration laws which included the hiring of 10,000 "additional immigration officers". His order requires the cooperation of state and local authorities. The order states "sanctuary jurisdictions" including "[sanctuary cities](./Sanctuary_city "Sanctuary city")" who refuse to comply will not be "eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary". Some officials claim that the "U.S. Constitution bars the federal government from commandeering state officials or using federal funds to 'coerce' states into doing the bidding of Washington." Mayors of New York, Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle have expressed concerns about the Order and do not want to "change the way their cities treat immigrants". [Jeff Sessions](./Jeff_Sessions "Jeff Sessions") is considered to be an "inspiration" for Trump's anti-immigration policies. On August 31, 2016, Trump laid out a 10-step plan as part of his immigration policy where he reiterated that all illegal immigrants are "subject to deportation" with priority given to illegal immigrants who have committed significant crimes and those who have overstayed visas. He noted that all those seeking legalization would have to go home and re-enter the country legally. In a meeting with concerned mayors, Sessions explained that the Executive Order merely directs cities to enforce the preexisting thirty-year-old law, 8 U.S.C. 1373 which means that "there is no sanctuary city debate." On April 25, U.S. District Judge [William Orrick III](./William_Orrick_III "William Orrick III") sided with San Francisco and Santa Clara in their lawsuit against the Trump administration, issuing a temporary injunction effectively blocking the order targeting so-called sanctuary cities. Justice Orrick said that the president "has no authority to attach new conditions to federal spending". Judge Orrick issued a nationwide permanent injunction on November 20, 2017, declaring that section 9(a) of [Executive Order 13768](./Executive_Order_13768 "Executive Order 13768") was "[unconstitutional on its face](./Facial_challenge "Facial challenge")" and violates "the [separation of powers doctrine](./Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution "Separation of powers under the United States Constitution") and deprives \[the plaintiffs\] of their [Tenth](./Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution") and [Fifth Amendment](./Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution") rights."

### Social policy

Main article: [Social policy of Donald Trump](./Social_policy_of_Donald_Trump "Social policy of Donald Trump")

Trump's appointment of a conservative justice, [Neil Gorsuch](./Neil_Gorsuch "Neil Gorsuch"), his reinstatement of the [Mexico City Policy](./Mexico_City_Policy "Mexico City Policy"), and his signing H.J. Res. 43—HHS Title X Funding for Planned Parenthood Rule are in keeping with his pro-life policy. On January 23, Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum on the [Mexico City Policy](./Mexico_City_Policy "Mexico City Policy") regarding federal funding to foreign [NGOs](./Non-governmental_organization "Non-governmental organization"). This is a key point in the [abortion debate](./Abortion_debate "Abortion debate") as foreign NGOs that receive US federal funding will no longer be able to offer, promote or perform abortion services as part of [family planning](./Family_planning "Family planning") in their own countries using non-U.S. government funds. [Forbes](./Forbes "Forbes") claimed this could "potentially affect $9.5 billion" in programs that reach "225 million women globally".

On April 13, Trump quietly signed H.J. Res. 43—HHS Title X Funding for Planned Parenthood Rule— reversing Obama's December 2016 regulation which had mandated that [Title X](./Title_X "Title X") recipients—like states local and state governments—distribute federal funds for services related to contraception, sexually transmitted infections, fertility, pregnancy care, and breast and cervical cancer screening to qualified health providers, regardless of whether they also perform abortions". _Bloomberg_ noted that although this was "one of the few opportunities" Trump has had in his first 100 days to enact legislation, he signed this bill in private. The Obama rule never came into effect as it was blocked by a federal judge. Republicans want to cut off federal funding from health-care organizations such as [Planned Parenthood](./Planned_Parenthood "Planned Parenthood") that perform abortions. Proponents of the bill claim it supports [states' rights](./States'_rights "States' rights") over federalist rights. The bill was passed under the procedures of the Congressional Review Act. In the Senate Vice-President Pence cast a tie-breaking vote. This will be an issue at the end of the first 100 days as Congress tries to avoid a government shutdown. In Fiscal Year 2014, Planned Parenthood clinics received $20.5 million of the $252.6 million distributed under the [Title X](./Title_X "Title X") Family Planning grant program.

The proposed [American Health Care Act](./American_Health_Care_Act "American Health Care Act"), announced by Congressional Republicans in March 2017, would have made Planned Parenthood "ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants".

### Suspended reduction of Federal Housing Mortgage Insurance Premium rates

Within the first hours of Trump's presidency, he "suspended indefinitely" the reduced "Mortgage Insurance Premiums for loans with Closing/Disbursement date on or after January 27, 2017", known as the [Federal Housing Administration](./Federal_Housing_Administration "Federal Housing Administration")'s (FHA) Annual [Mortgage Insurance](./Mortgage_Insurance "Mortgage Insurance") Premium (MIP) Rates managed under the [United States Department of Housing and Urban Development](./United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development "United States Department of Housing and Urban Development") (HUD). It is "effective immediately". Obama's rate cut would have lowered borrowing costs for first time and low income house buyers.

### Gun control

In February 2017, the Trump administration signed into law a bill that [rolled back a regulation implemented by the Obama administration](./Congressional_Review_Act "Congressional Review Act"), which would have prohibited approximately 75,000 individuals who were receiving Social Security disability and had representative payees, from owning guns. The bill was supported by the ACLU, the National Association for Mental Health, The American Association of People with Disabilities, and the National Council on Disability, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, as well as other disability rights advocates. The initial regulation was supported by the Brady Campaign to Stop Gun Violence, Moms Demand Action Against Gun Violence, Democratic gun control advocates, and some mental health experts.

### High-priority infrastructure

Main article: [Executive Order 13766](./Executive_Order_13766 "Executive Order 13766")

On January 24, Trump signed his [second](./List_of_executive_actions_by_Donald_Trump "List of executive actions by Donald Trump") Executive Order entitled Expediting Environmental Reviews and Approvals for High Priority Infrastructure Projects (EO 13766) which is part of a series of five executive orders to date. This Order was part of a series "designed to speed environmental permitting and reviews" as " major infrastructure projects trigger an array of overlapping environmental and natural resource laws and requirements".

On April 19, Trump signed a bill that extended the [VA's Choice](./Veterans'_Access_to_Care_through_Choice,_Accountability,_and_Transparency_Act_of_2014 "Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014") beyond August. The 2014 Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act was enacted in by the Obama administration in response to the [Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014](./Veterans_Health_Administration_scandal_of_2014 "Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014").

## Foreign policy

Main article: [Foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration](./Foreign_policy_of_the_Donald_Trump_administration "Foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration")

The main group advising the President on foreign affairs and national security is the [National Security Council](./United_States_National_Security_Council "United States National Security Council") (NSC) which coordinates national agencies such as the secretaries of defense and state; the secretaries of the army, navy, and air force.

On April 10, _[The Wall Street Journal](./The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal")_ described Trump's foreign policy as moving away from the "America First", "isolationist" policies towards more "mainstream" and "conventional" tendencies under the more stabilizing influence of Tillerson, Mattis, McMaster, Ross, and Kushner.

On the first day of Trump's presidency, the White House website had posted a 220-word description of its foreign policy. It was [protectionist](./Protectionist "Protectionist") with a focus on "America First", as was his inaugural address. His three top priorities were to defeat ISIS, to rebuild the military, and to embrace diplomacy.

### Defense

At the time Trump took office, [U.S. military spending](./Military_budget_of_the_United_States "Military budget of the United States") had reached its highest peak ever. Trump requested $30 billion for FY 2017 which ends in September, and an increase of $54 billion to Defense Department for FY 2018. The $639 billion in FY2018 would result in deep cuts to many other departments including the State Department, the diplomatic arm of the administration.

After Trump's April 12 first face-to-face meeting with [NATO](./North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization "North Atlantic Treaty Organization") Secretary General [Jens Stoltenberg](./Jens_Stoltenberg "Jens Stoltenberg"), Trump announced that he had changed views about NATO. Trump had previously complained that NATO was "obsolete" as it did not fight terrorism. On March 18, Trump called on NATO's member nations to contribute more to NATO. After the White House meeting, Trump realized that NATO has been engaged in combating groups like ISIS. Trump will maintain the "US commitment to NATO while reiterating its member nations must step up their military financing".

On January 29, Trump authorized the first military operation of his Presidency—a [raid by US commandos](./Yakla_raid "Yakla raid") on Al-Qaeda in Yakla, Baida in Yemen. At least 14 jihadists were killed in the raid, as well as 10 civilians, including children. The raid also resulted in the death of Chief Petty Officer [William Owens](./William_Owens_\(Navy_SEAL\) "William Owens (Navy SEAL)") a 36-year-old Virginia-based [Navy SEAL](./United_States_Navy_SEALs "United States Navy SEALs"), the first U.S. combat casualty in Trump's presidency.

According to _The New York Times_, Owen's death "came after a chain of mishaps and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious 50-minute firefight that also left three others wounded and a $75 million aircraft deliberately destroyed."

On April 6, 2017, Trump ordered [a missile strike](./2017_Shayrat_missile_strike "2017 Shayrat missile strike") on [Shayrat Air Base](./Shayrat_Air_Base "Shayrat Air Base") near Homs, in Syria. 59 Tomahawk missiles were launched from the [USS _Ross_ (DDG-71)](./USS_Ross_\(DDG-71\) "USS Ross (DDG-71)") and [USS _Porter_ (DDG-78)](./USS_Porter_\(DDG-78\) "USS Porter (DDG-78)") from the [Mediterranean Sea](./Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea").

On April 8, four days after North Korea had test-fired a ballistic missile, an announcement by the [United States Pacific Command](./United_States_Pacific_Command "United States Pacific Command") (PACOM) commander was posted via U.S. Third Fleet Public Affairs stating that PACOM had ordered the _[USS Carl Vinson](./USS_Carl_Vinson "USS Carl Vinson")_ [supercarrier](./Supercarrier "Supercarrier") to "sail north and report on station in the Western Pacific Ocean". It was a premature announcement that led to a "glitch-ridden sequence of events"—a result of confusion created by a "miscommunication" between the Pentagon and the White House. On April 8 and April 9, media outlets such as Fox News, RT, CNN, USA Today, BBC and others had published the erroneous announcement that warships were heading to the Korean Peninsula within the context of escalating US-North Korean tensions. In an interview with FOX Business Network's [Maria Bartiromo](./Maria_Bartiromo "Maria Bartiromo") that aired on April 12, President Trump warned, "We are sending an armada. Very powerful. We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier. That I can tell you." By April 17, North Korea's deputy [United Nations](./United_Nations "United Nations") ambassador accused the United States of "turning the Korean peninsula into "the world's biggest hotspot" and the North Korean government stated "its readiness to declare war on the United States if North Korean forces were to be attacked." On April 17, the _Defense News_ broke the story that the _Carl Vinson_ and its escorts were 3,500 miles from Korea, engaged in scheduled joint [Royal Australian Navy](./Royal_Australian_Navy "Royal Australian Navy") exercises in the Indian Ocean. According to Dana White, the Pentagon's chief spokeswoman, the _Carl Vinson_ was heading north on April 18. The _Wall Street Journal_ reported on April 19, that the incident sparked both "criticism and ridicule" as some felt "duped by Trump". In the article, [Hong Joon-pyo](./Hong_Joon-pyo "Hong Joon-pyo"), a candidate in the 2017 South Korean presidential election, was quoted as saying, "What [President Donald Trump](./Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") said was important for the national security of South Korea. If that was a lie, then during Trump's term, South Korea will not trust whatever Trump says."

On April 13, the United States dropped a ["mother of all bombs"](./GBU-43/B_Massive_Ordnance_Air_Blast "GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast") (MOAB) in the [Nangarhar Province](./Nangarhar_Province "Nangarhar Province") [Afghanistan](./Afghanistan "Afghanistan")— the first use of the bomb on the battlefield. On [April 8](./2017_in_Afghanistan "2017 in Afghanistan"), Staff Sgt. Mark De Alencar was killed [during an operation against ISIS in Nangarhar Province](./War_in_Afghanistan_\(2015–2021\)#2017 "War in Afghanistan (2015–2021)").

The most consequential shift in Trump's defense policy was the April 6 cruise-missile launch at a Syrian airbase.

On January 23, Trump fulfilled a campaign pledge by signing an executive order withdrawing the United States from the [Trans-Pacific Partnership](./Trans-Pacific_Partnership "Trans-Pacific Partnership") (TPP) or Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA). According to the BBC, Trump had pledged to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and he signed an executive order on the TPP his first few days. However, the EO was largely symbolic since the deal has not been ratified by a divided US Congress." The [Trans-Pacific Partnership](./Trans-Pacific_Partnership "Trans-Pacific Partnership") (TPP) or Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), was a trade agreement between the United States and eleven [Pacific Rim](./Pacific_Rim "Pacific Rim") nations—[Australia](./Australia "Australia"), [Brunei](./Brunei "Brunei"), [Canada](./Canada "Canada"), [Chile](./Chile "Chile"), [Japan](./Japan "Japan"), [Malaysia](./Malaysia "Malaysia"), [Mexico](./Mexico "Mexico"), [New Zealand](./New_Zealand "New Zealand"), [Peru](./Peru "Peru"), [Singapore](./Singapore "Singapore"), and [Vietnam](./Vietnam "Vietnam") that would have created a "free-trade zone for about 40 percent of the world's economy.

On April 18, 2017, President Trump signed **Executive Order 13788**, which directed federal agencies to implement a "Buy American and Hire American" strategy. The executive order directed federal agencies to implement a new system that favored higher-skilled, higher-paid applicants. The order was the first initiative in response to a key pledge made by Trump during his presidential campaign to promote 'Buy American, Hire American'. The EO was intended to order federal agencies to review and propose reforms to the [H-1B visa](./H-1B_visa "H-1B visa") system. Through the order, Trump stated his broad policy of economic nationalism without having to go through Congress. Cabinet secretaries from Departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security, and State would "fill in the details with reports and recommendations about what the administration can legally do". Trump argued that the EO would "end the 'theft of American prosperity'", which he said had been brought on by low-wage immigrant labor. The OMB and Department of Commerce issued a memorandum on implementation across federal [procurement](./Government_procurement_in_the_United_States "Government procurement in the United States") and [grant](./Grant_\(money\) "Grant (money)")-making activities in June 2017. The order was revoked by [President Biden](./Joe_Biden "Joe Biden") on 25 January 2021.

On March 31, President Donald Trump signed two [executive orders](./Executive_order_\(United_States\) "Executive order (United States)") on trade. One examines forms of "trade abuse", taking a country-by-country as well as product and industry look over 90 days at cheating, law enforcement, and currency misalignment by foreign countries that causes U.S. trade deficits. President Trump said the order ensures "that we fully collect all duties imposed on foreign importers that cheat, the cheaters". Another to strengthen [anti-dumping](./Dumping_\(pricing_policy\) "Dumping (pricing policy)") rules and countervailing duties. The order directs [Homeland Security](./United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security "United States Department of Homeland Security"), [Commerce](./United_States_Department_of_Commerce "United States Department of Commerce"), and [Treasury](./U.S._Department_of_the_Treasury "U.S. Department of the Treasury") departments to ensure enforcement and "those who break the rules will face severe consequences".

Trump, who had been dismissive of the [Export-Import Bank](./Export–Import_Bank_of_the_United_States "Export–Import Bank of the United States") (ExIm), made an about-face on April 15 by nominating Scott Garrett as head of the ExIm breaking a deadlock that had prevented the Bank from operating since 2014. Although Trump had privately made known that he would not side with "conservative Republicans, including those in his own administration", who wanted to "cripple" the ExIm in February, he did not announce it publicly until April 13, when he told _The Wall Street Journal_ that he would fill two seats of ExIm's five-seat board which would allow the Bank to make loans greater than $10 million. Trump had been one of ExIm's harshest critics. Conservatives call it the 'Bank of Boeing' and an 'epicenter of [crony capitalism](./Crony_capitalism "Crony capitalism")'. Its supporters such as Boeing and General Electric Co, claim that it facilitates trade worth billions of dollars in exports helping hundreds of businesses. Prior to making the announcement, Trump held two significant meetings related to ExIm—an April 3 formal visit with Egyptian president [Abdel Fattah el-Sisi](./Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi"), who was negotiating for billions of dollars in ExIm financing, and an April 11 meeting with Boeing Chief Executive [Jim McNerney](./Jim_McNerney "Jim McNerney"). Sisi also met with Lockheed Martin and General Electric CEOs during his visit to the U.S. in April.

### International relations

#### Australia

Main article: [Australia–United States relations](./Australia–United_States_relations "Australia–United States relations")

A February 2 report by _[The Washington Post](./The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")_ claimed that US President Donald Trump berated the [Australian](./Prime_Minister_of_Australia "Prime Minister of Australia"), Prime Minister [Turnbull](./Malcolm_Turnbull "Malcolm Turnbull") during one of Trump's first phone calls made to foreign officials. Trump stated that the 2016 asylum deal was an attempt to export the next [Boston bombers](./Boston_Marathon_bombing "Boston Marathon bombing") to the United States. The contentious deal involves a 2016 agreement between the Obama administration and Australia whereby the U.S. would resettle 1,250 refugees held in controversial offshore immigration detention facilities—[Manus](./Manus_Regional_Processing_Centre "Manus Regional Processing Centre") and [Nauru](./Nauru_Regional_Processing_Centre "Nauru Regional Processing Centre") islands. In return, Australia would 'resettle refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras". The full transcript of that phone conversation was leaked in August 2017, and published by the Washington Post. Later that day, Trump explained that while he respected Australia, they, along with many other countries, were "terribly taking advantage" of the United States. The following day, [Australian Ambassador to the United States](./List_of_ambassadors_of_Australia_to_the_United_States "List of ambassadors of Australia to the United States") [Joe Hockey](./Joe_Hockey "Joe Hockey") was sent to the White House and held meetings with [White House Chief Strategist](./White_House_Chief_Strategist "White House Chief Strategist") [Steve Bannon](./Steve_Bannon "Steve Bannon") and [Chief of Staff](./White_House_Chief_of_Staff "White House Chief of Staff") Reince Priebus. Spicer described the phone call as "very cordial". The 25-minute phone call on January 28, was described as "acrimonious" by Reuters and Trump's "worst call by far" with a foreign leader by _The Washington Post_. During a joint news conference with Prime Minister Turnbull, Vice-President Pence—who was on a "10-day, four-country trip" in April to [the Pacific Rim](./The_Pacific_Rim "The Pacific Rim")—announced that even if the United States did not "admire the agreement", Trump had made it clear the United States would honour the 2016 agreement to resettle refugees. Turnbull responded, "whatever the reservations of the president are", the decision "speaks volumes for the commitment, the integrity of President Trump, and your administration, sir, to honour that commitment." "The US is Australia's most important security partner, while China is its most important trading partner."

#### Canada

Main article: [Canada–United States relations](./Canada–United_States_relations "Canada–United States relations")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Justin_Trudeau_and_Donald_Trump_in_February_2017_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Justin_Trudeau_and_Donald_Trump_in_February_2017_%28cropped%29.jpg)](./File:Justin_Trudeau_and_Donald_Trump_in_February_2017_\(cropped\).jpg)Prime Minister [Justin Trudeau](./Justin_Trudeau "Justin Trudeau") (left) and President [Donald Trump](./Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") (right) meet in Washington in February 2017.

Prime Minister [Justin Trudeau](./Justin_Trudeau "Justin Trudeau") met Trump in Washington, D.C., in February 2017. Trudeau said that "The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern," referring to Trump's "refugee ban"—[Executive Order 13769](./Executive_Order_13769 "Executive Order 13769"). The two leaders emphasized the importance of the two countries' ongoing relationship, with Trudeau adding that "there are times when we have differed in our approaches. And that's always been done firmly and respectfully." Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that, "It has been a bad week for U.S.-Canada trade relations", as he announced tariffs of up to 24% on Canadian lumber on April 24, as dairy product trade fell through. The [Canada–United States softwood lumber dispute](./Canada–United_States_softwood_lumber_dispute "Canada–United States softwood lumber dispute") has been since ongoing since the 1980s making it one of the longest trade disputes between the two countries, as well as one of the largest. Trump is under pressure to begin renegotiating NAFTA, the trade deal between Canada, Mexico and the US. On April 25, Canada's International Trade Minister [Francois-Philippe Champagne](./Francois-Philippe_Champagne "Francois-Philippe Champagne") and soft lumber industry representatives promoted trade with China in Beijing in response to what is perceived as U.S. protectionist policies.

#### China

Main articles: [China–United States relations § Trump administration (2017–2021)](./China–United_States_relations#Trump_administration_\(2017–2021\) "China–United States relations"), and [Foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration § China](./Foreign_policy_of_the_Donald_Trump_administration#China "Foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration")

The [Mar-a-Lago](./Mar-a-Lago "Mar-a-Lago") summit meeting on April 6 and 7 between Trump and [President](./President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China "President of the People's Republic of China") [Xi Jinping](./Xi_Jinping "Xi Jinping") of China, during the first 100 days of the new US administration, was heralded by _The Telegraph_ as the "most significant bilateral summit in decades". In spite of differences regarding Taiwan, the South China Sea and the most urgent issue—North Korea's [nuclear programme](./North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction "North Korea and weapons of mass destruction")—"the summit between the US and Chinese presidents had both symbolic and tangible successes," according to the _[South China Morning Post](./South_China_Morning_Post "South China Morning Post")_. During the April 7–8 visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump acknowledged that international relations are much more complicated than he had imagined. In regards to North Korea, he had hoped to negotiate better trade deals with China in exchange for China dealing with the nuclear threat from North Korea. In an interview with _Wall Street Journal_'s Gerald F. Seib Trump said, "After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it's not so easy. I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power \[over\] North Korea. ... But it's not what you would think." Trump also affirmed that North Korea was the United States' "biggest international threat".

The BBC reported on April 19 that China "was 'seriously concerned" about nuclear threats" as tensions between North Korea and the United States escalated with a "war of words" between North Korea's leader [Kim Jong-un](./Kim_Jong-un "Kim Jong-un") and the Trump administration. Recent threats included Vice President Mike Pence's statement that the period of "strategic patience" was over and his April 19 statement that the US "would meet any attack with an 'overwhelming response'". North Korea recently warned of "full-out nuclear war if Washington takes military action against it." Trump has called for China to rein in North Korea, but [state media](./State_media "State media") outlet _[China Daily](./China_Daily "China Daily")_ opined that "Washington must be aware of the limitations to Beijing's abilities, and refrain from assuming that the matter can be consigned entirely to Beijing alone." _China Daily_ considered the U.N. Security Council statement adopted on April 20 condemning North Korea's recent attempted missile launch, as an indication that the Trump administration is considering a "diplomatic solution".

In an April 12 interview with _Wall Street Journal_, Trump said he had changed his mind and he would not label China a currency manipulator, which had been one of his 100-day pledges. By April he believed that China had not been manipulating its currency for months. He did not want to "jeopardize" talks with the Chinese "on confronting the threat of North Korea". Early in Trump's presidency, the world's largest financial newspaper, _[Nikkei Asian Review](./Nikkei_Asian_Review "Nikkei Asian Review")_, had reported on February 1, that Trump had labelled China and Japan as currency manipulators.

The Trump administration confirmed its commitment to defend Japan against China's claims to the [Senkaku Islands](./Senkaku_Islands "Senkaku Islands") in the [East China Sea](./East_China_Sea "East China Sea") through the [Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan](./Treaty_of_Mutual_Cooperation_and_Security_between_the_United_States_and_Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan") during a U.S. Defense Secretary [James Mattis](./James_Mattis "James Mattis")'s visit to Japan on February 4. By February 9, [US-Chinese relations](./China–United_States_relations "China–United States relations")—the most important bilateral relationship—had remained strained, President Xi Jinping and Trump had not spoken and this had "drawn increasing scrutiny". Xi was concerned by the December 2, 2016, phone call from Taiwan President [Tsai Ing-wen](./Tsai_Ing-wen "Tsai Ing-wen") to Trump and Trump's questioning of the One China policy. On February 10, Trump and Xi Jinping spoke on the phone for the first time since Donald Trump took office, during which Donald Trump committed to honoring the [One China](./One_China "One China") policy at Xi's request.

During the [World Economic Forum](./World_Economic_Forum "World Economic Forum") annual meeting in [Davos](./Davos "Davos") on January 17–20, China's President [Xi Jinping](./Xi_Jinping "Xi Jinping"), as keynote speaker, "vigorously" defended globalization in a speech that the _[Financial Times](./Financial_Times "Financial Times")_ described as "one would have expected to come from a US president". Mr. Xi observed that "blaming economic globalisation for the world's problems is inconsistent with reality ... globalisation has powered global growth and facilitated movement of goods and capital, advances in science, technology and civilisation, and interactions among people In 2015, China became the United States' largest trade partner, placing Canada second. The _Times_ 2017 article, citing an analysis by [Peterson Institute for International Economics](./Peterson_Institute_for_International_Economics "Peterson Institute for International Economics"), noted that "China and Mexico together account for a quarter of US trade". Concerns have been raised about Trump's proposed imposition of a 45 percent tariff on imports from China. On January 23, The [U.S. Commerce Department](./United_States_Department_of_Commerce "United States Department of Commerce") announced new [countervailing duties](./Countervailing_duties "Countervailing duties") (CVDs) ranging from 38.61 to 65.46 percent on Chinese vehicles in the [antidumping](./Dumping_\(pricing_policy\) "Dumping (pricing policy)") case. In 2015, over 8.9 million Chinese truck and bus tires worth $1.07 billion were imported to the United States.

At his Senate confirmation hearing as Secretary of State, in mid-January, Rex Tillerson's statements about the [South China Sea](./South_China_Sea "South China Sea"), "set the stage for a possible crisis between the world's two biggest economies should his comments become official American policy" and "put further strains on one of the world's most important bilateral relationships." According to an article on January 28, in the _[South China Morning Post](./South_China_Morning_Post "South China Morning Post")_, an official from China's [Central Military Commission](./Central_Military_Commission_\(China\) "Central Military Commission (China)")'s Defence Mobilisation Department, ranking Chinese military official considers war between China and the United States a real possibility during Trump's term as president. An article in _[The Guardian](./The_Guardian "The Guardian")_ claims, "The bad news is that if in the coming months or years Trump faces an ignominious end to his presidency through scandal or mismanagement, a national crisis—involving China, or [ISIS](./ISIS "ISIS") or another foreign actor—could allow him to cling to power."

#### Egypt

Main article: [United States–Egypt relations](./United_States–Egypt_relations "United States–Egypt relations")

On April 3, Trump hosted a formal visit with [Egyptian president](./Egyptian_president "Egyptian president") [Abdel Fattah el-Sisi](./Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi"), in an effort to "reset" relations between the two countries, offering the U.S. government's "strong backing". Ties between the two countries were strained since Sisi deposed Egyptian president [Mohamed Morsi](./Mohamed_Morsi "Mohamed Morsi") during the [July 2013 military coup](./2013_Egyptian_coup_d'état "2013 Egyptian coup d'état"). Trump publicly stated that Sisi's autocratic leadership was 'fantastic'. Sisi, who is seeking "billions of dollars in financing" from the [Export-Import Bank](./Export–Import_Bank_of_the_United_States "Export–Import Bank of the United States") for large investments in infrastructure investments, also met with the representatives from the IMF, the World Bank, Lockheed Martin and General Electric. Trump nominated a new head of ExIm which facilitates its operation—the ExIm had been hamstrung since 2014 because of opposition by Republicans. During his talks with Sisi in April, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman [Bob Corker](./Bob_Corker "Bob Corker") (R-Tenn.) had advocated for the release of six humanitarian workers, including a U.S. citizen—30-year-old Aya Hijazi and her husband, who had been imprisoned in Egypt since May 1, 2014. A court in Egypt dropped all charges against them on April 16.

#### European Union

Main article: [United States–European Union relations](./United_States–European_Union_relations "United States–European Union relations")

In a 60-minute interview at Trump Tower in mid-January, with [Michael Gove](./Michael_Gove "Michael Gove") of the _[Times of London](./Times_of_London "Times of London")_ and Kai Diekmann of _[Bild](./Bild "Bild")_, Trump praised [Brexit](./Brexit "Brexit"), criticized [NATO](./NATO "NATO") as "obsolete", and the [European Union](./European_Union "European Union") as "basically a vehicle for Germany". He said it was a "very catastrophic mistake" on [Angela Merkel](./Angela_Merkel "Angela Merkel")'s part to admit a million refugees—whom he refers to as "illegals". These "worrying declarations", among others, compelled the [President of the European Council](./President_of_the_European_Council "President of the European Council"), [Donald Tusk](./Donald_Tusk "Donald Tusk"), to raise concerns in a letter to 27 European leaders, that the Trump administration seemed to "question the last 70 years of American foreign policy", placing the European Union in a "difficult situation".

#### Iran

Main article: [Iran–United States relations](./Iran–United_States_relations "Iran–United States relations")

There are no formal diplomatic relations between [Iran](./Iran "Iran") and the United States. Iranian citizens were temporary banned from entering the United States by the executive order "Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States." Late on April 18, 2017, the Trump Administration certified that Iran had continued to comply with the [2015 nuclear framework agreement](./Iran_nuclear_deal_framework "Iran nuclear deal framework"). During his campaign, Trump had denounced the agreement as 'the worst deal ever' but was frustrated in his plans to renegotiate the nuclear deal as "canceling the deal would likely cause significant problems."

#### Israel

Main article: [Israel–United States relations](./Israel–United_States_relations "Israel–United States relations")

Israel's prime minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](./Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu") and Trump held their first official visit at the White House on February 15. At the press conference, Trump urged Netanyahu to "'hold back' on building Jewish settlements on territories occupied by Israel in 1967 'for a little bit'". According to _The Economist_, Trump appeared to step back from the "long-standing, bipartisan American insistence that peace can be reached only through the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state alongside the Jewish one", the two-state solution. Trump's priority of destroying the [Muslim](./Sunni_Islam "Sunni Islam") radicals of Islamic State (IS)" differs from Netanyahu's. Israel is more concerned about "containing Iran, the largest power in the [Shia](./Shia_Islam "Shia Islam") Muslim world. Given that Iran is itself fighting IS in Syria and Iraq, the two goals could even be in conflict." In a marked change from his visit to the White House under the Obama administration, Netanyahu blurred the distinction by "denouncing both IS and Iran in the same attack on 'militant Islam' and hailing Mr Trump's 'great courage' in tackling 'radical Islamic terror'".

#### Mexico

Main article: [2017 Mexico–United States diplomatic crisis](./2017_Mexico–United_States_diplomatic_crisis "2017 Mexico–United States diplomatic crisis")

Since early in Trump's presidency, Mexico and United States faced a [diplomatic crisis](./2017_Mexico–United_States_diplomatic_crisis "2017 Mexico–United States diplomatic crisis"). [Mexican President](./Mexican_President "Mexican President") [Enrique Peña Nieto](./Enrique_Peña_Nieto "Enrique Peña Nieto") opposes Trump's approach to the renegotiation of [NAFTA](./North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement "North American Free Trade Agreement") and the implications of Trump's Executive Order 13767. After decades of cooperation between the two nations relations between the US and Mexico are seriously weakened.

#### North Korea

Main article: [North Korea–United States relations](./North_Korea–United_States_relations "North Korea–United States relations")

On February 12, North Korea tested a [ballistic solid-fuel missile](./Ballistic_missile "Ballistic missile"), the [Pukkuksong-2](./Pukkuksong-2 "Pukkuksong-2"), which is part of a series of [missile tests](./North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction "North Korea and weapons of mass destruction") that have largely defined the hostile North Korea–United States relations over recent years. According to _The Economist_, on February 13, while Trump promised "to deal with the 'big, big' problem of North Korea 'very strongly'", he has few options. Trump received the news of the launch during the first official visit of Japan's prime minister, [Shinzo Abe](./Shinzo_Abe "Shinzo Abe"). They were dining at [Mar-a-Lago](./Mar-a-Lago "Mar-a-Lago"), Trump's Florida resort.

#### Russia

Main article: [Russia–United States relations](./Russia–United_States_relations "Russia–United States relations")

According to a _Reuters_ report on February 9, 2017, in his first 60-minute telephone call with [Putin](./Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin"), Putin inquired about extending [New START](./New_START "New START") (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) a [nuclear arms reduction](./Nuclear_disarmament "Nuclear disarmament") treaty between the United States and the Russia signed in 2010, which was expected to last until 2021. and, after ratification, Trump denounced the treaty claiming that it favored Russia and was "one of several bad deals negotiated by the Obama administration". _The New York Times_ reported that on February 14, Russia deployed a new type of fully operational ground-launched intermediate-range [cruise missile](./Cruise_missile "Cruise missile") that "violates a landmark arms control treaty". The Americans have changed its name from SSC-X-8 to SSC-8, reflecting its status as "operational" not "X" referring to "in development".

On February 16, 2017, President Trump's Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, declared that the United States was not currently prepared to collaborate with Russia on military matters—including future anti-ISIL US operations.

On February 24, Trump "risked triggering a new Cold War-style arms race between Washington and Moscow. In an interview with _Reuters_, Trump said that the "treaty limiting Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals was a bad deal for Washington" and he "would put the U.S. nuclear arsenal "at the top of the pack". In response, Russia's [Konstantin Kosachev](./Konstantin_Kosachev "Konstantin Kosachev") wrote on his Facebook page, "arguably Trump's most alarming statement on the subject of relations with Russia".

> Trump's campaign slogan 'Make America great again', if that means nuclear supremacy, will return the world to the worst times of the arms race in the '50s and '60s.
> 
> — [Konstantin Kosachev](./Konstantin_Kosachev "Konstantin Kosachev"), Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian [Federation Council](./Federation_Council_\(Russia\) "Federation Council (Russia)") February 24, 2017

Trump had "promised one of the 'greatest military buildups in American history' in a feisty, campaign-style speech extolling robust nationalism" at the annual [Conservative Political Action Conference](./Conservative_Political_Action_Conference "Conservative Political Action Conference") on February 24 at [National Harbor](./National_Harbor,_Maryland "National Harbor, Maryland").

#### Syria

Main article: [Syria–United States relations](./Syria–United_States_relations "Syria–United States relations")

On April 5, 2017, Trump responded to the [April 4 chemical attack](./2017_Khan_Shaykhun_chemical_attack "2017 Khan Shaykhun chemical attack") allegedly by Syrian Armed Forces on rebel-held [Khan Shaykhun](./Khan_Shaykhun "Khan Shaykhun") in [Idlib Province](./Idlib_Governorate "Idlib Governorate"), which enveloped men, women, and children in a suffocating fog of [sarin](./Sarin "Sarin") gas, leaving more than eighty people dead and over three hundred more injured, saying that "... my attitude towards Syria and Assad has changed very much." Both Tillerson and Nikki Haley had previously stated that the Trump administration had no intention of interfering in President [Bashar Assad](./Bashar_Assad "Bashar Assad")'s leadership in the [Syrian Civil War](./Syrian_Civil_War "Syrian Civil War"), as the US focused on eliminating ISIS.

#### United Kingdom

Main article: [United Kingdom–United States relations](./United_Kingdom–United_States_relations "United Kingdom–United States relations")

In January 2017, the Prime Minister [Theresa May](./Theresa_May "Theresa May") invited Trump to a [state visit](./State_visit "State visit") to the UK when she met Trump in Washington DC. The visit was planned to occur in June, although it may be delayed to July to coincide with the [upcoming G20 summit](./2017_G20_Hamburg_summit "2017 G20 Hamburg summit") in Hamburg. Some sources have suggested that the UK government may delay the visit until after the House of Commons is in recess for the summer to avoid criticism from [MPs](./Member_of_parliament "Member of parliament"). The [Speaker of the House of Commons](./Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_\(United_Kingdom\) "Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)"), [John Bercow](./John_Bercow "John Bercow"), stated on February 6, 2017, that Trump would not be welcome to address parliament during any future state visit, drawing applause and cheering from some Members of Parliament.

More than 1,860,000 people signed a petition to prevent Trump from making an official state visit, which states that such a visit "would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen". The [FCO](./Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office "Foreign and Commonwealth Office") responded to this petition by stating that HM Government recognises the strong views expressed by the many signatories of this petition, but does not support this petition." [Lord Ricketts](./Peter_Ricketts,_Baron_Ricketts "Peter Ricketts, Baron Ricketts"), former [Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs](./Permanent_Under-Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_Affairs "Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs"), said that the unprecedented speed of May's invitation has put the Queen in a "very difficult situation". He questioned whether Trump was "specially deserving of this exceptional honour", given that US presidents are usually only invited to such visits after at least a year in office. Writing to May, opposition leader [Jeremy Corbyn](./Jeremy_Corbyn "Jeremy Corbyn") stated that the "invite should be withdrawn until the executive orders are gone".

It was suggested that Trump's visit would have to take place outside London, after [Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe](./Bernard_Hogan-Howe "Bernard Hogan-Howe"), the chief of the [Metropolitan Police](./Metropolitan_Police "Metropolitan Police"), said that he had concerns about the visit given the number of protests expected. One suggestion considered was for Trump to address a rally at the [National Exhibition Centre](./National_Exhibition_Centre "National Exhibition Centre") in [Birmingham](./Birmingham "Birmingham"), a city where 50.4% of voters voted to [leave the EU](./Brexit "Brexit"), rather than London, which saw 59.9% voting to remain. Local politicians and activists in Birmingham promised to stage protests if the visit is moved, with [Shabana Mahmood](./Shabana_Mahmood "Shabana Mahmood"), Labour MP for the [Birmingham Ladywood constituency](./Birmingham_Ladywood_\(UK_Parliament_constituency\) "Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)"), saying that "President Trump with his hateful and divisive rhetoric, policies and Muslim ban is not welcome here."

During a March 14 _Fox & Friends_ interview, [Andrew Napolitano](./Andrew_Napolitano "Andrew Napolitano") said, "Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command, using the British [GCHQ](./GCHQ "GCHQ") to implement [surveillance on Donald Trump](./Donald_Trump_wiretapping_claim "Donald Trump wiretapping claim") to avoid leaving 'American fingerprints'." On March 16, Press Secretary Sean Spicer repeated Napolitano's claim at a White House press briefing. The following day, a GCHQ spokesperson called Napolitano's claim "utterly ridiculous". The White House denied reports that it had apologized to the British government for the accusation.

### Supreme Court nomination

Main article: [Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination](./Neil_Gorsuch_Supreme_Court_nomination "Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Donald_Trump_with_Neil_Gorsuch_01-31-17.jpg/220px-Donald_Trump_with_Neil_Gorsuch_01-31-17.jpg)](./File:Donald_Trump_with_Neil_Gorsuch_01-31-17.jpg)Judge Neil Gorsuch, his wife Louise, and President Donald Trump during the announcement in the [East Room](./East_Room "East Room") of the White House

On the evening of January 30, Trump announced his [nomination](./Neil_Gorsuch_Supreme_Court_nomination "Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination") of U.S. Appeals Court judge [Neil Gorsuch](./Neil_Gorsuch "Neil Gorsuch") for the [Supreme Court](./Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States "Supreme Court of the United States") fulfilling his campaign pledge that he would choose someone 'in the mold' of the late Justice [Antonin Scalia](./Antonin_Scalia "Antonin Scalia").

Following the February 3 ruling by federal judge James Robart, which temporarily blocked Trump's travel ban on people from seven Muslim countries, Trump has been openly critical of the Federal judiciary. According to _CNN_ and _Washington Post_, on February 8, Gorsuch expressed concern that Trump's remarks on the judiciary were 'demoralizing' and 'disheartening' to the independence of the judiciary.

Gorsuch was approved by the Senate Judiciary committee on April 3. Senate Republicans invoked the "[nuclear option](./Nuclear_option "Nuclear option")" after the April 6 [filibuster](./Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate "Filibuster in the United States Senate") that prevented [cloture](./Cloture "Cloture"). After a year-long Republican block on nominations, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch's nomination with a 54–45 vote, mainly along party lines. Gorsuch took office in a private ceremony on April 10.

Hours after Gorsuch and four other Supreme Court conservatives justices voted on April 20 to deny a stay of execution request from eight inmates on Arkansas death-row, Ledell Lee was put to death with a lethal injection, the [first in Arkansas since 2005](./Capital_punishment_in_Arkansas "Capital punishment in Arkansas"). Two inmates—Jack Jones and Marcel Williams—received lethal injections on April 24.

### Monetary policy

On April 19, in an interview with _The Wall Street Journal_—in a reversal of previous statements—Trump said he was considering keeping [Janet Yellen](./Janet_Yellen "Janet Yellen") as chair of the [Federal Reserve System](./Federal_Reserve_System "Federal Reserve System"), which oversees the [U.S. monetary policy](./Monetary_policy_of_the_United_States "Monetary policy of the United States"). He explained that, "I do like a low-interest rate policy, I must be honest with you." In the same interview, Trump said he would not label China a currency manipulator, which had been one of his 100-day pledges. Trump expressed concerns in that interview that, "I think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that's my fault because people have confidence in me. But that's hurting—that will hurt ultimately." He believes a low dollar favors the U.S. in international trade. From November 8, 2016—when Trump was elected—to December 30, 2016, the [trade-weighted average of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar (TWEXB)](./Trade-weighted_US_dollar_index "Trade-weighted US dollar index") increased 4.4 percent. Towards the end of the first 100 days, the TWEXB had dropped two percent. This table shows some highs and lows of the Trade Weighted U.S. Dollar Index: Broad \[TWEXB\] from 2002 to April 2017.

### Small government

On January 23, President Trump signed an executive order that froze all federal hiring except for the military. The order specified that no new positions can be created and no currently vacant positions may be filled unless an agency head believes that the position is "necessary to meet national security or public safety responsibilities". The order is due to expire once the head of the [Office of Management and Budget](./Office_of_Management_and_Budget "Office of Management and Budget"), [Mick Mulvaney](./Mick_Mulvaney "Mick Mulvaney"), creates a "long-term plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government's workforce through attrition".

On January 24, the [Associated Press](./Associated_Press "Associated Press") reported on emails from the Administration to some government agencies sent shortly after the inauguration, which "detailed specific prohibitions" banning certain government agencies, such as the Agricultural Research Service [Agriculture Department](./United_States_Department_of_Agriculture "United States Department of Agriculture") from issuing "press releases, blog updates or posts to the agency's social media accounts". In what the Associated Press described as a "broader communications clampdown within the executive branch", the Administration "instituted a media blackout". In his January 25 press briefing, White House press secretary [Sean Spicer](./Sean_Spicer "Sean Spicer") claimed that the emails did not come from the Administration: "They haven't been directed by us to do anything ... That directive did not come from here."

On January 23, in a Presidential Memorandum, the president ordered a [temporary government-wide hiring freeze](./2017_United_States_federal_hiring_freeze "2017 United States federal hiring freeze") of the civilian work force in the executive branch, which is managed by the [Office of Personnel Management](./United_States_Office_of_Personnel_Management "United States Office of Personnel Management"). This will prevent federal agencies, except for the offices of the new presidential appointees, national security, the military and public safety, from filling vacant positions. The [Brookings Institution](./Brookings_Institution "Brookings Institution") questioned whether this freeze would include financial regulators who exercise independence from the executive branch—such as the [Federal Reserve Board of Governors](./Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors "Federal Reserve Board of Governors") (Fed), [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](./Office_of_the_Comptroller_of_the_Currency "Office of the Comptroller of the Currency") (OCC), the [Securities and Exchange Commission](./Securities_and_Exchange_Commission "Securities and Exchange Commission") (SEC) among others. In a [Fox News](./Fox_News "Fox News") report, based on statistics from the Office of Personnel Management, the number of executive branch employees "hasn't been this low since 1965" and has been "more or less steady" since 2001.

### Economic policy of Donald Trump

Main article: [Economic policy of Donald Trump](./Economic_policy_of_Donald_Trump "Economic policy of Donald Trump")

Trump's key economic policies included the dismantling of the [Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](./Dodd–Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act "Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act"), and the repeal of the [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act](./Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act") (ACA).

According to the April 28, 2017, Commerce Department report, in the first quarter of 2017, there was a "sharp decline from the 2.1% in Q1 2016 to 0.7% in Q1 2017—representing the weakest quarterly economic growth in three years. The report presents a statistical analysis of the American economy in the 2017 Q1—the gross domestic product (GDP). In spite of the soft GDP, by the end of Q1 2017, the [S&P 500](./S&P_500 "S&P 500") was near an all-time high, representing a 12% rise from the first quarter of 2016, as investor confidence remained elevated based on Trump's promise to cut taxes, deregulate and spend heavily on infrastructure such as roads and bridges.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/US_Employment_Statistics.svg/250px-US_Employment_Statistics.svg.png)](./File:US_Employment_Statistics.svg)[Unemployment in the United States](./Unemployment_in_the_United_States "Unemployment in the United States") 2009–2016. Jobless rate was 4.5 in March 2017.

In March 2017, the unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent and the [Consumer Sentiment Index](./University_of_Michigan_Consumer_Sentiment_Index "University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index") reached 125.6, a level of consumer confidence in the United States last seen in December 2000. It fell to 120.3 in April. Consumer confidence or soft data contrasted with real consumer spending or hard data, with a "big drop-off" in the amount Americans actually spent during Trump's first 100 days.

#### Changes to Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

Main article: [Executive Order 13772](./Executive_Order_13772 "Executive Order 13772")

On February 3, after a meeting with his strategic and policy forum, which included [Jamie Dimon](./Jamie_Dimon "Jamie Dimon"), Chairman and CEO [JPMorgan Chase](./JPMorgan_Chase "JPMorgan Chase"), Trump issued an Executive Order, Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System, which directed the "Treasury secretary to submit a report on recommended changes to bank regulations in 120 days." Trump wants to get "banks to lend money more aggressively" and wants to make changes to the [Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](./Dodd–Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act "Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act") (2010) which was enacted in response to the [Great Recession](./Great_Recession "Great Recession"), bringing significant changes to U. S. [financial regulation](./Financial_regulation "Financial regulation").

> We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank ... Frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses that can't borrow money. They just can't get any money because the banks won't let them borrow because of rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.
> 
> — Trump in meeting with his business advisory council, February 3

In an interview on February 3, with _The Wall Street Journal_, Trump's [National Economic Council](./National_Economic_Council_\(United_States\) "National Economic Council (United States)") Director, [Gary Cohn](./Gary_Cohn_\(investment_banker\) "Gary Cohn (investment banker)"), announced the planned rollback of the fiduciary rule, which stated that brokers and advisers who work with tax-advantaged retirement savings "must work in the best interest of their clients" even at the expense of their own profits.

### Deregulation

One of the first acts by the Trump administration was an order signed by [Chief of Staff](./White_House_Chief_of_Staff "White House Chief of Staff") [Reince Priebus](./Reince_Priebus "Reince Priebus") on January 20, under the subject "Regulatory Freeze Pending Review" to all Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies ordering agencies to immediately suspend all pending regulations and to "send no regulation" to the [Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs](./Office_of_Information_and_Regulatory_Affairs "Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs") (OFR) until the Trump administration can review them except for "emergency situations" or "urgent circumstances" allowed by the Director or Acting Director, Mark Sandy, of the [Office of Management and Budget](./Office_of_Management_and_Budget "Office of Management and Budget") (OMB). This was comparable to prior moves by the Obama and Bush administrations shortly after their inaugurations to revert [executive orders](./Executive_order_\(United_States\) "Executive order (United States)") by outgoing presidents, signed in their final days in office.

On January 30, Trump signed his seventh Executive Order "Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs".

#### Deregulation and corporations

At a January 23 meeting with leaders of the United States' largest corporations, including [Ford](./Ford_Motor_Company "Ford Motor Company")'s [Mark Fields](./Mark_Fields_\(businessman\) "Mark Fields (businessman)"), [Dell Technologies](./Dell_Technologies "Dell Technologies")' [Michael Dell](./Michael_Dell "Michael Dell"), [Lockheed Martin](./Lockheed_Martin "Lockheed Martin")'s [Marillyn Hewson](./Marillyn_Hewson "Marillyn Hewson"), [Under Armour](./Under_Armour "Under Armour")'s [Kevin Plank](./Kevin_Plank "Kevin Plank"), [Arconic](./Arconic "Arconic")'s [Klaus Kleinfeld](./Klaus_Kleinfeld "Klaus Kleinfeld"), [Whirlpool](./Whirlpool "Whirlpool")'s Jeff Fettig, [Johnson & Johnson](./Johnson_&_Johnson "Johnson & Johnson")'s [Alex Gorsky](./Alex_Gorsky "Alex Gorsky"), [Dow Chemical](./Dow_Chemical "Dow Chemical")'s [Andrew Liveris](./Andrew_Liveris "Andrew Liveris"), [U.S. Steel](./U.S._Steel "U.S. Steel")'s [Mario Longhi](./Mario_Longhi "Mario Longhi"), [SpaceX](./SpaceX "SpaceX")'s [Elon Musk](./Elon_Musk "Elon Musk"), [International Paper](./International_Paper "International Paper")'s [Mark Sutton](./Mark_Sutton "Mark Sutton"), and [Corning](./Corning_Inc. "Corning Inc.")'s Wendell Weeks promised to reward the companies who stay in the United States with aggressive cuts on U.S. federal regulations governing their companies by "75 percent or more".

##### Trump meets with CEOs of pharmaceutical companies

On January 31, Trump met with CEOs of pharmaceutical firms, including [Novartis](./Novartis "Novartis")'s [Joseph Jimenez](./Joseph_Jimenez "Joseph Jimenez") who also represented the [Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America](./Pharmaceutical_Research_and_Manufacturers_of_America "Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America")—the pharmaceutical industry's powerful lobbying group, [Merck & Co.](./Merck_&_Co. "Merck & Co.")'s [Kenneth Frazier](./Kenneth_Frazier "Kenneth Frazier"), [Johnson & Johnson](./Johnson_&_Johnson "Johnson & Johnson"), [Celgene](./Celgene "Celgene")'s [Robert Hugin](./Robert_J._Hugin "Robert J. Hugin"), [Eli Lilly](./Eli_Lilly "Eli Lilly"), [Amgen](./Amgen "Amgen")'s [Robert Bradway](./Robert_A._Bradway "Robert A. Bradway"). Trump called for lower prices, "We have no choice. For Medicare, for Medicaid. We have to get the prices way down." In return, he promised to boost the pharmaceutical companies competitiveness by curbing regulations "from 9,000 pages" to "100 pages", and by lowering pharmaceutical companies' tax rates. Trump noted that [Food and Drug Administration](./Food_and_Drug_Administration "Food and Drug Administration") (FDA) approvals "force pharmaceutical companies to spend years and billions of dollars developing drugs". He promised his nomination for FDA Commissioner would oversee an FDA overhaul. In the listening session with pharmaceutical industry leaders, Trump noted that, "it costs sometimes $2.5 billion on average, actually, to come up with a new product. ... 15 years, $2.5 billion to come up with a product where there's not even a safety problem. So it's crazy. I'm surprised you can't get them to move faster than that."

Trump had promised in March 2016, to reform the pharmaceutical industry, including the removal of existing free market barriers to allow imported, dependable, safe, reliable, and cheaper drugs from overseas, bringing more options to American consumers. Following Trump's press conference on January 11, _Fortune_ claimed that the largest pharmaceutical companies had lost over $20 billion in 20 minutes. The [Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act](./Medicare_Prescription_Drug,_Improvement,_and_Modernization_Act "Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act") (2003) expressly prohibited Medicare from negotiating bulk prescription drug prices and Trump had pledged to revert this. Following the morning meeting with CEOs on January 31, Trump abandoned his pledge to allow "Medicare negotiate bulk discounts in the price it pays for prescription drugs."

### Limitations on executive agency members lobbying

On January 28, Trump signed an Executive Order to fulfilling his campaign pledge to limit lobbying of executive agency members.

### Department of Justice

Main articles: [United States Attorney General](./United_States_Attorney_General "United States Attorney General") and [United States Department of Justice](./United_States_Department_of_Justice "United States Department of Justice")

On February 8, Alabama Senator [Jeff Sessions](./Jeff_Sessions "Jeff Sessions"), who was nominated by Trump in January, was confirmed as [United States Attorney General](./United_States_Attorney_General "United States Attorney General") (A.G.), the head of the [Justice Department](./United_States_Department_of_Justice "United States Department of Justice") per [28 U.S.C.](./Title_28_of_the_United_States_Code "Title 28 of the United States Code") [§ 503](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/503). He is the United States government's chief law enforcement officer and lawyer with 113,000 employees working under his leadership. According to _The Washington Post_, Sessions' "conservative, populist views have shaped many" of Trump's "early policies, including on immigration". The nomination battle was described by _The New York Times_, as "a bitter and racially charged". The confirmation process for Trump's nominee Senator [Jeff Sessions](./Jeff_Sessions "Jeff Sessions") was described as " strikingly contentious" by _The New York Times_; with _Fox News_ calling it a "wild night", and CNN calling the "rare rebuke" a "stunning moment" as [Senator Mitch McConnell](./Senator_Mitch_McConnell "Senator Mitch McConnell") invoked [Rule XIX](./Standing_Rules_of_the_United_States_Senate,_Rule_XIX "Standing Rules of the United States Senate, Rule XIX") to silence Senator [Elizabeth Warren](./Elizabeth_Warren "Elizabeth Warren") for the rest of the hearing. McConnell interrupted Warren as she read several pages by [Coretta Scott King](./Coretta_Scott_King "Coretta Scott King") and Senator [Ted Kennedy](./Ted_Kennedy "Ted Kennedy") regarding Session's alleged racial bias from the 500-plus page transcript submitted in 1986, that contributed to the decision by the then-Republican-led Judiciary Committee to reject his nomination to a federal judgeship. Warren immediately live-streamed her reading of the letter, critical of Sessions, that the widow of [Martin Luther King Jr.](./Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Martin Luther King Jr.") had written to Senator [Strom Thurmond](./Strom_Thurmond "Strom Thurmond") in 1986. and numerous media outlets made the full-text available.

Trump appointed [Dana J. Boente](./Dana_J._Boente "Dana J. Boente") to serve as acting Attorney General until Session's Senate Confirmation. After firing Yates, Trumped signed his eleventh [Executive Order 13775](./Executive_Order_13775 "Executive Order 13775") on February 9, specifically reversing the DOJ's [line of succession](./Line_of_succession "Line of succession") in Obama's EO 13762 in order to appoint the [United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia](./United_States_Attorney_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Virginia "United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia")—Dana J. Boente—as Acting Attorney General. Trump revoked EO 13775 on March 31 with "Presidential Executive Order on Providing an Order of Succession Within the Department of Justice.

Boente had replaced Acting Attorney General [Sally Yates](./Sally_Yates "Sally Yates") who was fired by Trump for ordering the Justice Department to not defend Trump's [Executive Order 13769](./Executive_Order_13769 "Executive Order 13769") which restricted entry to the United States. Yates claimed that, "At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities \[of the Department of Justice\], nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful".

### Voter fraud claims

Since November 2016, and during his presidency, Trump has repeated [voter fraud](./Voter_impersonation "Voter impersonation") allegations that between three and five million people voted illegally and cost him the [popular vote](./Popular_vote_\(representative_democracy\) "Popular vote (representative democracy)") to [Hillary Clinton](./Hillary_Clinton "Hillary Clinton"), and also that thousands of voters were illegally bused from Massachusetts into New Hampshire where former Senator [Kelly Ayotte](./Kelly_Ayotte "Kelly Ayotte") was defeated, and where Trump narrowly lost to Clinton in 2016.

Trump had announced on January 25 that he was conducting an investigation into voter fraud. He repeated unsubstantiated claims about the number of fraudulent voters and referred to VoteStand founder [Gregg Phillips](./Gregg_Phillips "Gregg Phillips"), who could not produce any evidence of voter fraud. In January, _[US News](./US_News_and_World_Report "US News and World Report")_ reported that members of Trump's cabinet and family were registered to vote in multiple states. On February 10, [Federal Election Commission](./Federal_Election_Commission "Federal Election Commission") (FEC) Commissioner [Ellen L. Weintraub](./Ellen_L._Weintraub "Ellen L. Weintraub") issued a statement calling on Trump to provide the evidence of what would "constitute thousands of felony criminal offenses under New Hampshire law." By February 12, Stephen Miller was still unable to provide concrete evidence to support claims of voter fraud in an interview with Stephanopoulos, but he seemed to direct Stephanopoulos to the often-cited 2012 [Pew Research Center](./Pew_Research_Center "Pew Research Center") study. In fact, the 2012 Pew report entitled "Inaccurate, Costly, and Inefficient Evidence That America's Voter Registration System Needs an Upgrade," which was based on 2008 data, was about "outdated voter rolls, not fraudulent votes" and "makes no mention of noncitizens voting or registering to vote." The report showed that because of inefficiencies in the voter system, 24 percent of eligible citizens were not able to be registered, representing "51 million citizens." Problems related to voter registration often affected "military personnel—especially those deployed overseas and their families—who were almost twice as likely to report registration problems as was the general public in 2008." In November, "the former director of Pew's election program" explained, "We found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted." On January 25, Spicer confirmed in a press briefing that Trump continued to believe that "millions voted illegally in the election" based on "studies and evidence that people have presented him." This included an often-cited and contested 2014 [Old Dominion University](./Old_Dominion_University "Old Dominion University") study entitled "Do non-citizens vote in U.S. elections?" Using Cooperative Congressional Election Study data from 2008 and 2010, the researchers had argued that more than 14% of non-citizens "indicated that they were registered to vote."

### 2018 United States federal budget

Main article: [2018 United States federal budget](./2018_United_States_federal_budget "2018 United States federal budget")

Trump submitted his first [budget](./United_States_federal_budget "United States federal budget") [request](./United_States_budget_process#The_President's_budget_request "United States budget process") which recommends funding levels for the next [fiscal year](./Fiscal_year "Fiscal year") [2018](./2018_United_States_federal_budget "2018 United States federal budget")—covering the period from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2018—to the [115th Congress](./115th_United_States_Congress "115th United States Congress"). Trump's request including a $639 billion [defense budget](./Military_budget_of_the_United_States "Military budget of the United States") and corresponding major cuts to other federal departments.

To avert a possible government shutdown, the Trump administration face an April 28 deadline—the expiration of the December 10, 2016, [continuing resolution](./Continuing_resolution "Continuing resolution") (H.R. 2028) ([Public Law 114-254](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Public_Law_114-254)). Discussion time on controversial issues such as funding for a border wall defunding [Planned Parenthood](./Planned_Parenthood "Planned Parenthood"), was limited by the two-week Easter recess that began on April 7. The government was shut down during the Clinton and Obama administrations as a result of clashes between Republicans in Congress and Democrats in the White House. In late April 2017, Republicans have control of both Congress and the White House. A shutdown would result in "government agencies \[locking\] their doors, national parks \[refusing\] visitors and federal workers \[being\] told not to report to work". The appropriations process cannot be accomplished without consulting the Democrats—unlike rolling back federal regulations with Congressional Review Acts and attempts to repeal Obamacare.

### Tax reform

The White House memo entitled "2017 Tax Reform for Economic Growth and American Jobs" was presented on April 26 in what _The Wall Street Journal_ described as his "finest moment" in the first 100 days and a policy and political success. Individual reform includes "reducing the  7 tax brackets to  3 tax brackets for 10%, 25% and 35%, doubling the standard deduction, providing tax relief for families with child and dependent care expenses." The taxation system will be simplified to "eliminate targeted tax breaks that mainly benefit the wealthiest taxpayers, protect the home ownership and charitable gift tax deductions, repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax, repeal the death tax and repeal the 3.8% Obamacare tax that hits small businesses and investment income." Business reform includes "15% business tax rate, territorial tax system to level the playing field for American companies, one-time tax on trillions of dollars held overseas and elimination of tax breaks for special interests." The memo did not provide legislative content but rather broad outlines that will be developed in Congress but may face some opposition from both sides.

## Energy, environmental, and science policy

Main article: [Environmental policy under the Trump administration](./Environmental_policy_under_the_Trump_administration "Environmental policy under the Trump administration")

### Climate change

Trump rescinded many Obama-era regulations aimed at cutting the volume of greenhouse gas emissions, which faced strong opposition and legal challenges. The key focus of his deregulatory efforts was the [Clean Power Plan](./Clean_Power_Plan "Clean Power Plan") created under the Obama administration, which restricted GHG emissions at coal-fired plants. Trump proposed defunding the Clean Power Plan in his FY2018 budget, and his March 28 executive order directed [Environmental Protection Agency](./Environmental_Protection_Agency "Environmental Protection Agency") administrator [Scott Pruitt](./Scott_Pruitt "Scott Pruitt") to review the Clean Power Plan. He also lifted a 14-month-old halt on new coal leases on federal lands.

### Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines

On January 24, Trump signed three Presidential Memoranda regarding construction of pipelines; "Regarding Construction of American Pipelines" was his [fifth](./List_of_executive_actions_by_Donald_Trump "List of executive actions by Donald Trump") memoranda, "Regarding Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline" was his sixth and the seventh was "Regarding Construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline". These were intended to "clear the way to government approval" of the [Dakota Access](./Dakota_Access_Pipeline "Dakota Access Pipeline") and the [Keystone XL](./Keystone_Pipeline "Keystone Pipeline") pipelines. In a meeting with small business leaders on January 30, Trump clarified that one of the reasons for approving the pipelines was to insist that pipeline makers implement a made-in-America approach. He revealed how the federal government could exercise eminent domain strategically in the appropriation of private land, to pressure pipeline makers to use American raw steel, for example.

### Deregulation on environmental policies and programs

Then [White House Chief of Staff](./White_House_Chief_of_Staff "White House Chief of Staff") [Reince Priebus](./Reince_Priebus "Reince Priebus") signed an order on January 24, temporarily delaying the [Environmental Protection Agency](./Environmental_Protection_Agency "Environmental Protection Agency")'s (EPA) 30 final regulations that were pending in the [Federal Register](./Federal_Register "Federal Register") until March 21, 2017. Employees in the EPA's Office of Acquisition Management, received an email "within hours of President Trump's swearing in", from the new EPA administration, asking "that all contract and grant awards be temporarily suspended, effective immediately" which included "task orders and work assignments" until "further clarification".

On February 1, the Trump administration published a Statement of Administration Policy to allow coal companies to dump mining waste in streams by nullifying the [Department of the Interior](./United_States_Department_of_the_Interior "United States Department of the Interior") regulation known as the "Stream Protection Rule", established in the [Obama administration](./Presidency_of_Barack_Obama "Presidency of Barack Obama"). Under the [Congressional Review Act](./Congressional_Review_Act "Congressional Review Act") Congress passed the resolution to repeal on February 1 and the Senate also approved it on February 2. The Statement nullified the Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation which limited venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production. The [Repeal of Stream Protection Rule](./Repeal_of_Stream_Protection_Rule "Repeal of Stream Protection Rule") ([115-5](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Public%20Law%20115-5 "s:Public Law 115-5")) was signed into law by Trump on February 16.

Additionally, the February 1 policy statement [nullified the rule on Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers](./Repeal_of_the_Disclosure_of_Payments_by_Resource_Extraction_Issuers_Rule "Repeal of the Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers Rule"), a [Securities and Exchange Commission](./Securities_and_Exchange_Commission "Securities and Exchange Commission") regulation which required resource extraction issuers to report payments "to governments for the commercial development of oil, natural gas or minerals". The [Repeal of the Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers Rule](./Repeal_of_the_Disclosure_of_Payments_by_Resource_Extraction_Issuers_Rule "Repeal of the Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers Rule") ([115-4](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Public%20Law%20115-4 "s:Public Law 115-4")) was signed into law by Trump on February 14, 2017.

On March 29, 2017, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt overturned the 2015 EPA revocation and denied the 2007 administrative petition by the [Natural Resources Defense Council](./Natural_Resources_Defense_Council "Natural Resources Defense Council") and the [Pesticide Action Network North America](./Pesticide_Action_Network_North_America "Pesticide Action Network North America") (PANNA) to ban the widely used [Dow Chemical Company](./Dow_Chemical "Dow Chemical")'s [chlorpyrifos](./Chlorpyrifos "Chlorpyrifos"). The eight-year delay by the EPA to respond to PANNA, had resulted in a court case, PANNA v. EPA, in which EPA was ordered to respond by October 2015. EPA revoked "all tolerances for the insecticide chlorpyrifos" and Pruitt overturned the 2015 decision.

On March 29, 2017, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt overturned the 2015 EPA revocation and denied the administrative petition by the [Natural Resources Defense Council](./Natural_Resources_Defense_Council "Natural Resources Defense Council") and the [Pesticide Action Network North America](./Pesticide_Action_Network_North_America "Pesticide Action Network North America") to ban chlorpyrifos.

> By reversing the previous administration's steps to ban one of the most widely used pesticides in the world, we are returning to using sound science in decision-making—rather than predetermined results.
> 
> — Statement by Scott Pruitt, EPA, Administrator March 29, 2017

Accompanied by coal executives and coal miners, Trump signed a "sweeping executive order" on March 28, at the EPA. In his remarks he praised coal miners along with pipelines and U.S. manufacturing and addressed the coal miners directly, "Come on, fellas. Basically, you know what this is? You know what it says, right? You're going back to work." Trump instructed EPA "regulators to rewrite key rules curbing U.S. carbon emissions and other environmental regulations."

## Acts of the 115th United States Congress

Main article: [List of Acts of the 115th United States Congress](./List_of_Acts_of_the_115th_United_States_Congress "List of Acts of the 115th United States Congress")

By April 10, Trump had signed 21 [Acts of Congress](./Act_of_Congress "Act of Congress") into law under the [115th United States Congress](./115th_United_States_Congress "115th United States Congress")—laws 115-2 through 115–22. The [GAO Access and Oversight Act of 2017](./GAO_Access_and_Oversight_Act_of_2017 "GAO Access and Oversight Act of 2017") ([Pub. L.](./Act_of_Congress#Public_law,_private_law,_designation "Act of Congress") [115–3 (text)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/3?link-type=html) [(PDF)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/3?link-type=pdf&.pdf),[H.R. 72](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/72)) was the second law Trump signed as president. The bill ensures that the [Government Accountability Office](./Government_Accountability_Office "Government Accountability Office") (GAO) has full access to the database, National Directory of New Hires, to ensure that recipients of federal means-tested programs like [Unemployment Insurance](./Unemployment_benefits#United_States "Unemployment benefits"), [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program](./Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program") (SNAP), [Earned income tax credit](./Earned_income_tax_credit "Earned income tax credit") (EITC), and [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families](./Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_Families "Temporary Assistance for Needy Families") (TANF) are eligible, thereby reducing government waste and increasing accountability.

### Congressional Review Act

Main article: [Congressional Review Act](./Congressional_Review_Act "Congressional Review Act")

Beginning in January, the Trump administration used the 1996 [Congressional Review Act](./Congressional_Review_Act "Congressional Review Act") (CRA) to overturn regulations—some of them major—finalized during the final months of Obama's tenure. By April 6, Trump had signed into law 11 resolutions of disapproval under the CRA, after they were passed by the Republican majority in the House and Senate. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can circumvent the Senate's filibuster to overturn legislation issued in the last 60 days of the previous administration.

On February 14, the [Repeal of the Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers Rule](./Repeal_of_the_Disclosure_of_Payments_by_Resource_Extraction_Issuers_Rule "Repeal of the Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers Rule") ([Pub. L.](./Act_of_Congress#Public_law,_private_law,_designation "Act of Congress") [115–4 (text)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/4?link-type=html) [(PDF)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/4?link-type=pdf&.pdf), [H.J.Res. 41](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/41)) was signed, nullifying the [Securities and Exchange Commission](./U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission") regulation known as the "Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers" rule. The SEC regulation was mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was similar to transparency initiatives adopted by the European Union and Canada. Advocates argued that "Disclosure of Payments" rule prevented companies from bribing foreign governments and engaging in other forms of corruption. Those who argued for its repeal claimed that rule had placed an excessive burden on American companies and created a competitive disadvantage.

On February 16, Trump signed the [Repeal of Stream Protection Rule](./Repeal_of_Stream_Protection_Rule "Repeal of Stream Protection Rule") ([H.J.Res. 38](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/38) [Pub. L.](./Act_of_Congress#Public_law,_private_law,_designation "Act of Congress") [115–5 (text)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/5?link-type=html) [(PDF)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/5?link-type=pdf&.pdf)), which nullified the [DOI](./United_States_Department_of_the_Interior "United States Department of the Interior") regulation known as the [Stream Protection Rule](./Stream_Protection_Rule "Stream Protection Rule").

On February 28, the [Repeal of the Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007](./Repeal_of_the_Implementation_of_the_NICS_Improvement_Amendments_Act_of_2007 "Repeal of the Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007") ([H.J.Res. 40](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/40) [Pub. L.](./Act_of_Congress#Public_law,_private_law,_designation "Act of Congress") [115–8 (text)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/8?link-type=html) [(PDF)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/8?link-type=pdf&.pdf)) was signed into law, which overturned the [Social Security Administration](./Social_Security_Administration "Social Security Administration") related to the implementation of the [NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007](./NICS_Improvement_Amendments_Act_of_2007 "NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007"), which had amended the [National Instant Criminal Background Check System](./National_Instant_Criminal_Background_Check_System "National Instant Criminal Background Check System") to prohibit those with severe mental illness from possessing firearms.

On March 27, Trump overturned the [Bureau of Land Management](./Bureau_of_Land_Management "Bureau of Land Management")'s (BLM), which nullified the "Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation", also known as "Methane and Waste Prevention" or "methane venting and flaring rule" which "limited venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production". with Bill ([H.J.Res. 44](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/44) [Pub. L.](./Act_of_Congress#Public_law,_private_law,_designation "Act of Congress") [115–11 (text)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/11?link-type=html) [(PDF)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/11?link-type=pdf&.pdf)) disapproved the [DOI](./Department_of_the_Interior "Department of the Interior") rule relating to [Bureau of Land Management](./Bureau_of_Land_Management "Bureau of Land Management") "regulations that established the procedures used to prepare, revise, or amend land use plans pursuant to the [Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976](./Federal_Land_Policy_and_Management_Act_of_1976 "Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976")". On the same day, he signed the "H.J.Res.37—Disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation" ([H.J.Res. 37](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/37) [Pub.

On March 27, he also signed the ED State and Local Education Accountability Rules ([H.J.Res. 57](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/57) [Pub. L.](./Act_of_Congress#Public_law,_private_law,_designation "Act of Congress") [115–13 (text)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/13?link-type=html) [(PDF)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/13?link-type=pdf&.pdf)), which overruled the Department of Education rule relating to accountability and State plans under the [Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965](./Elementary_and_Secondary_Education_Act_of_1965 "Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965") and the ED Teacher Preparation Rule ([H.J.Res. 58](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/58) [Pub.

On March 31, Trump signed the [DOL](./United_States_Department_of_Labor "United States Department of Labor") Unemployment Insurance Drug Testing Rule ([H.J.Res. 42](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/42) [Pub.

Supporters included Republicans who regarded the rule as executive overreach and trade groups that represent Internet service providers.

On April 13, Trump signed the law which overturned the HHS [Title X](./Title_X "Title X") Funding for Planned Parenthood Rule.

## Media coverage

On February 16, 2017, Trump held an hour-and-a-quarter-long press conference to "update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration." CNN described it as an "animated and unorthodox" intervention in which Trump appeared to be "deeply frustrated" by the way he was being portrayed by the media. The media has often described the administration as chaotic, while Trump claimed it was "running like a fine-tuned machine". Trump said that "the stock market has hit record numbers ... there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, and ... a new [Rasmussen Reports](./Rasmussen_Reports "Rasmussen Reports")' poll which put his "approval rating at 55 percent and going up". Trump dismissed polls that gave lower numbers, such as those by [Gallup](./Gallup_\(company\) "Gallup (company)") and Pew Research Center, which reported 40% and 39%, respectively. When asked by an Associated Press journalist about Trump's performance at the press conference, Trump's supporters said he came across as the "champion of Middle America ... taking on the establishment and making good on his campaign promises to put the country first."

[NBC News](./NBC_News "NBC News"), _[The Huffington Post](./The_Huffington_Post "The Huffington Post")_/[YouGov](./YouGov "YouGov"), Gallup, [SurveyMonkey](./SurveyMonkey "SurveyMonkey"), [Rasmussen Reports](./Rasmussen_Reports "Rasmussen Reports"), the [Associated Press](./Associated_Press "Associated Press")/[NORC](./NORC_at_the_University_of_Chicago "NORC at the University of Chicago"), Pew Research Center, [Quinnipiac University](./Quinnipiac_University "Quinnipiac University"), _[The Economist](./The_Economist "The Economist")_/[YouGov](./YouGov "YouGov"),_[The Wall Street Journal](./The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal")_, [Reuters](./Reuters "Reuters")/[Ipsos](./Ipsos "Ipsos"), and [ABC News](./ABC_News_\(United_States\) "ABC News (United States)")/_[The Washington Post](./The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")_ are among the organizations undertaking [opinion polls](./Opinion_polling_on_the_first_Donald_Trump_administration "Opinion polling on the first Donald Trump administration") on Trump's [approval ratings](./United_States_presidential_approval_rating "United States presidential approval rating").

An April meeting of thirty White House staff members—including Communications Director, [Mike Dubke](./Mike_Dubke "Mike Dubke"), [Jessica Ditto](./Jessica_Ditto "Jessica Ditto"), and Kellyanne Conway—brainstormed on how to "repackage" the symbolic First 100 Days—which ends April 29—and to "rebrand Trump" by focusing on three main areas—prosperity, accountability and safety. The first includes "new manufacturing jobs, reduced regulations and pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal", the second "swamp-draining campaign promises such as lobbying restrictions" and the third "the dramatic reduction in border crossings and the strike in Syria". _Politico_ summarized this period as "marred by legislative stumbles, legal setbacks, senior staff kneecapping one another, the resignation of his national security adviser and near-daily headlines and headaches about links to Russia." CNN called it "largely win-less", _The Atlantic_ described its as a "disaster" marked by "chaos, confusion, and infighting" comparing it to [Bill Clinton's in 1993](./Presidency_of_Bill_Clinton "Presidency of Bill Clinton"). _[The Washington Times](./The_Washington_Times "The Washington Times")_ claimed the numerous mainstream media descriptions of Trump's "worst 100 days" failed to mention the accomplishments: the TPP withdrawal, the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines approvals, the proposed "streamlined budget" with a "Reagan-era increase to national defense", immigration laws enforcement "which decreased illegal border crossing by 40 percent in his first month", and Gorsuch's "incredibly smooth" nomination to the Supreme Court, the Dow Jones 20,000-point threshold, and rebounding manufacturing and mining jobs".

### Sean Spicer

Main article: [Sean Spicer](./Sean_Spicer "Sean Spicer")

Sean Spicer was named as Trump's [White House Press Secretary](./White_House_Press_Secretary "White House Press Secretary") on December 22, 2016, and his [Communications Director](./Communications_Director "Communications Director") on December 24. after the resignation of [Jason Miller](./Jason_Miller_\(communications_strategist\) "Jason Miller (communications strategist)"). At his first official press conference, on January 21, Spicer criticized the media for underestimating the size of the crowds at the inauguration under Trump's direct orders.

On February 1, Spicer held his sixth press briefing, which for the first time included a number of Skype Seats as [Chuck Todd](./Chuck_Todd "Chuck Todd") had suggested on January 23. Spicer fielded questions from Kim Kalunian ([WPRI](./WPRI "WPRI")) in Rhode Island, Natalie Herbick (Fox 8) in Cleveland, Ohio, [Lars Larson](./Lars_Larson "Lars Larson") of the Lars Larson Show and Jeff Jobe of Jeff Jobe Publishing, South Central Kentucky. CBS NEWS reported that some journalists labelled their questions as "softball", others welcomed them. Spicer had also delivered a tense five-minute post-inauguration news conference on January 21. The Skype solution helped resolve a concern about moving to a larger press room. By February 13, Jim Hoft, from [Gateway Pundit](./Gateway_Pundit "Gateway Pundit") and the "freshly minted White House correspondent", 28-year-old artist Lucian Wintrich, were granted White House press credentials and attended the press conference with Trump and the Canadian prime minister, [Justin Trudeau](./Justin_Trudeau "Justin Trudeau").

On February 4, [Melissa McCarthy](./Melissa_McCarthy "Melissa McCarthy") lampooned Spicer on _[Saturday Night Live](./Saturday_Night_Live "Saturday Night Live")_. On February 7, [CNN](./CNN "CNN") reported that "President Donald Trump was disappointed with Spicer and with Priebus, who had recommended him.

On February 24, journalists from _The New York Times_, _The Los Angeles Times_, CNN and _Politico_, _The Los Angeles Times_, and BuzzFeed were barred from Sean Spicer's small, off-camera press briefing or "gaggle", held in his office. Conservative-leaning Breitbart News, _One America News Network_, and _The Washington Times_ were invited along with Fox News, Reuters, Bloomberg News, CBS and Hearst Communications. Reporters from the _Associated Press_ and _Time_ walked out of the briefing in protest. Media outlets allowed into the gaggle shared full details of the briefing, including their audio, with the entire press corps. Fox News "joined a complaint by the chair of the five-network television pool", although their journalist was not banned. The [White House Communications Agency](./White_House_Communications_Agency "White House Communications Agency") (WHCA) lodged a complaint. Spicer explained that the White House is fighting against "unfair coverage".

> I think we're going to aggressively push back. We're just not going to sit back and let false narratives, false stories, inaccurate facts get out there.
> 
> — Sean Spicer on barring media from February 24 "gaggle"

On April 11, while defending President Trump's decision to bomb Syria, Spicer compared President [Bashar al-Assad](./Bashar_al-Assad "Bashar al-Assad") to [Adolf Hitler](./Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") and stated that even Hitler had not used chemical weapons on his own people during [World War II](./World_War_II "World War II"), ignoring the Germany's use of gas chambers during the [Holocaust](./Holocaust "Holocaust"). Spicer apologized on the next day, saying, "I got into a topic that I shouldn't have, and I screwed up."

### Kellyanne Conway

Main article: [Kellyanne Conway](./Kellyanne_Conway "Kellyanne Conway")

By February 3, televised interviews by [Kellyanne Conway](./Kellyanne_Conway "Kellyanne Conway"), [Counselor to the President](./Counselor_to_the_President "Counselor to the President"), were dominating the news cycle in the First 100 Days, according to the _Washington Post_ claiming it was partly because of "misconstrued facts" and "falsehoods". Examples include the February 2 interview on _[Hardball with Chris Matthews](./Hardball_with_Chris_Matthews "Hardball with Chris Matthews")_, where she cited a fictitious incident involving two Iraqi refugees in Kentucky in 2011, who she claimed were the masterminds behind the [Bowling Green massacre](./Bowling_Green_massacre "Bowling Green massacre"), which she claimed was "brand new information" that had "very little \[media\] coverage".

Conway promoted Ivanka Trump's business On February 9, on _[Fox & Friends](./Fox_&_Friends "Fox & Friends")_ in response to [Nordstrom](./Nordstrom "Nordstrom")'s decision to drop her products. Organizations filed formal ethics complaints against Conway for violating federal law prohibiting use of a federal position "for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise". [Public Citizen](./Public_Citizen "Public Citizen") asked the [Office of Governmental Ethics](./United_States_Office_of_Government_Ethics "United States Office of Government Ethics") (OGE) to investigate and [Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](./Citizens_for_Responsibility_and_Ethics_in_Washington "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington") filed a similar complaint.

## Investigations into Russian interference in the election

Main article: [Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections](./Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections "Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections")

Three separate investigations on [Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections](./Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections "Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections") include those undertaken by the FBI, the [Senate Intelligence Committee](./Senate_Intelligence_Committee "Senate Intelligence Committee") and the [House Intelligence Committee](./House_Intelligence_Committee "House Intelligence Committee").

On March 20, in a House Intelligence Committee public hearing [FBI Director](./FBI_Director "FBI Director") [James Comey](./James_Comey "James Comey") confirmed that the FBI has been conducting a broad [counter-intelligence](./Counter-intelligence "Counter-intelligence") investigation of Russian interference in the elections starting in July 2016, which includes investigations into possible links between Trump associates and Russia. Comey stated that the FBI has no evidence that corroborates Trump's [March 4 wiretapping claim](./Trump_Tower_wiretapping_allegations "Trump Tower wiretapping allegations"). On March 22, [Devin Nunes](./Devin_Nunes "Devin Nunes"), Republican chairman of the committee, held a press conference to reveal that, based on classified reports he had seen, U.S. intelligence agencies had incidentally collected communications of Trump's transition team, and that Trump associates' names were unmasked in the reports.

The next House Intelligence Committee hearings will be closed and will include NSA Director [Mike Rogers](./Michael_S._Rogers "Michael S. Rogers") and Comey. Nunes canceled the public hearing with "former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, former CIA Director [John Brennan](./John_O._Brennan "John O. Brennan"), and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper". On April 6, 2017, Nunes temporarily recused himself from the Russia investigation, as the [House Ethics Committee](./United_States_House_Committee_on_Ethics "United States House Committee on Ethics") began investigating claims that he improperly disclosed classified information. He called the allegations "entirely false". [Mike Conaway](./Mike_Conaway "Mike Conaway") (R-TX) replaced Nunes to lead the investigation.

## Re-election campaign

Further information: [Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign](./Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign")

Trump filed a form with the [Federal Election Commission](./Federal_Election_Commission "Federal Election Commission") declaring his eligibility to run for re-election in 2020 within hours of his taking office. The first rally paid for by the campaign took place at the [Melbourne Orlando International Airport](./Melbourne_Orlando_International_Airport "Melbourne Orlando International Airport") near Orlando, Florida, on February 18, 2017. The campaign rally was the earliest such event by any incumbent U.S. president in history. During the event, Trump defended his actions as president and criticized the media.

In August 2016, In a significant flip-flop, Trump said that his Administration would now be willing to work with NATO. Just five months ago, he charged that NATO had become "obsolete"—a word he repeated six times on ABC's "This Week". The world's most powerful military alliance "doesn't discuss terrorism," he said in March \[2016\]. "NATO's not meant for terrorism. NATO doesn't have the right countries in it for terrorism." At the time, he suggested the creation of a whole new international coalition as an alternative. In Ohio \[on August 15, 2016\], he reversed his position, because NATO had "changed their policy" since his previous comments. The truth is that NATO has engaged in Afghanistan since 2001—its first mission beyond Europe—and has been training Iraqi forces since 2004.

[Elsevier](./Elsevier "Elsevier"): 149–57. [doi](./Doi_\(identifier\) "Doi (identifier)"):[10.1016/j.electstud.2014.09.001](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.electstud.2014.09.001). This analysis provides some of the first available nationwide estimates of the portion of non-citizen immigrants who vote in U.S. elections. These estimates speak to an ongoing debate concerning non-citizen voting rights within the United States (DeSipio, 2011, Earnest, 2008, FAIR, 2004, Fund and von Spakovsky, 2012, Hayduk, 2006, Immigration Policy Center, 2012 and Munro, 2008; Song, 2009 and Von Spakovsky, 2012) and they also speak to broader global questions concerning the normative political place of non-citizens in democratic politics.
